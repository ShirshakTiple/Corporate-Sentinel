Apple warns some Indian users their iPhone may be bugged by Pegasus-type spyware,"Apple has sent a fresh round of threat notifications to some of its users in India, along with 91 other countries, warning them that their iPhone could have been potentially attacked by “mercenary spyware,” including the Israeli NSO Group’s controversial Pegasus malware.
Applehas not attributed the recent wave of attacks to any stakeholder. Last October, it had sent a similar notification to Opposition leaders across parties — from Congress’sShashi Tharoorto AAP’s Raghav Chadha to TMC’sMahua Moitra— warning of a “potential state-sponsored spyware attack” on their iPhones.
The company, after pressure from the government, had later clarified that it “does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker”.
The threat notification emails were sent at around 12.30 am IST on Thursday (April 11) to impacted users in India. It is unclear how many people have received the threat notification from Apple. The email also mentions the NSO-Group’sPegasusspyware, saying tools like those are being used to target people on an ongoing basis globally.
“ALERT: Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone,” reads the subject line of the threat notification, a copy of which has been seen byThe Indian Express.
“Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-. This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously,” the notification email added.
“Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware. These attacks cost millions of dollars and are individually deployed against a very small number of people, but the targeting is ongoing and global,” Apple said in its threat notification.
The company advised users to be cautious with all links they receive, and not to open any links or attachments from unexpected or unknown senders.
The company, however, said it was unable to provide more information about what caused it to send the threat notification, as that could help mercenary spyware attackers “adapt their behaviour to evade detection in the future”.
Apple has also updated its support page to include tips for users who had been possible targets of the mercenary spyware attack. “Apple threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks, likely because of who they are or what they do,” the iPhone maker said.
Apple started sending these threat notifications in 2021, and since then individuals in 150 countries have received them. When it had sent the notification last year, at least 20 Indians with iPhones had received them.
Investigations into similar issues in the past haven’t yielded much. In 2021, the Supreme Court had formed a committee of technical experts to look into allegations of unauthorised surveillance using the Pegasus software developed by Israeli firm NSO Group.
The Pegasus controversy had broken following media reports of alleged illegal use of the software to tap the phones of some activists, journalists and politicians. Subsequently, several petitions were filed in the Supreme Court seeking an inquiry into the charges.
In August 2022, the committee of technical experts found no conclusive evidence on use of the spyware in phones examined by it but noted that the Central Government “had not cooperated” with the panel.

Apple plans Mac line overhaul with AI-focused M4 chips,"Follow Us
Apple is nearing the production of M4 computer processors which would have AI processing capabilities and plans to update every Mac model with it,Bloomberg Newsreported on Thursday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
The company is aiming to release the updated computers late this year and early next year, and they would include new iMacs, a low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, and Mac minis, the report said.
PC makers have been in a slump since the end of a pandemic-era boom in sales for working and learning from home. The industry has pinned its hopes of a revival on a new generation of laptops and desktops with more powerful chips that can handle artificial intelligence tasks such as summarizing documents without having to send data to the cloud.
Intel is preparing such chips, as are rivals including Qualcomm.
Reutershas reported that Nvidia also plans to use its strength in AI chips to jump into the PC market with a new chip as early as 2025.
Apple is planning to highlight the AI processing capabilities of the new chips, and how they'll integrate with the next version of macOS, according to theBloomberg report.
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The news comes ahead of Apple's annual developers conference in June, and reports said the iPhone maker could announce new AI partnership and unveil significant changes to the iOS. Mac sales fell 27 per cent in Apple's most recent fiscal year ended September.
Apple in October unveiled the current-generation M3 chips and new MacBook Pro and iMac computers that were getting them.

Apple Sends New Spyware Alert To iPhone Users In India And More Countries: Here’s What It Says,"Reported By:S Aadeetya
News18.com
Last Updated:April 11, 2024, 18:21 IST
Delhi, India
iPhone users in India and other 91 countries have got a new spyware alert this week.
Apple iPhone users in India and over 91 countries have got a new spyware attack notification from the company on April 11 at 12:30 AM IST which could be as dangerous as the NSO Group’s Pegasus. The company has sent out this alert previously as well, and does so when it detects major intrusion in iPhone and other devices.
The company says, “today’s notification is being sent to targeted users in 92 countries, and to date we have notified users in over 150 countries in total,” which includes iPhone users from India as well. “Apple sends an email and iMessage notification to the email addresses and phone numbers associated with the user’s Apple ID,” the company explains in its supportpagehere. It was not immediately clear who and how many users received the notification in India.
“Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID . This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do,” the notification email reads that affected iPhone users have received.
Apple has refused to share the details from where these attacks originate, and even in this case, the mail alert reaching the iPhone users clearly states the following, “The extreme cost, sophistication, and worldwide nature makes mercenary spyware attacks some of the most advanced digital threats in existence today. As a result, Apple does not attribute the attacks or the notice you’re receiving to any specific attackers or geographical regions.”
The spyware warning also mentions that Pegasus-like spyware used to attack iPhones are rare and they are specifically targeted at an individual with clear reasons to infiltrate their device. “Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware.”
The emailer quickly cites some important tips to the affected iPhone users in the country, asking them to enable lockdown mode on their iPhones right away, update to the latest iOS 17.4.1 version, update all the other Apple devices they use, and avoid entertaining messages and links from strangers to avoid further damage or data loss.
According to government sources, the recent alert was prompted after a government body CERT-In wrote to Apple on April 10.
CERT-In asked Apple on April 10 to clarify whether any new vulnerabilities have been reported to or found by Apple including their related patches developed to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
On the same day, CERT-In also requested Apple to inform such new vulnerabilities and patch information to Apple users to enable the prevention of any malicious activity
CERT-In has been very active in detecting cyber attacks on Indian users and systems while being in constant touch with Apple on reported vulnerabilities in its products."
"Apple to move half of its supply chain from China to India, employ 5 lakh people in 3 years","Apple and its ecosystem has directly created 1,50,000 jobs in India and an additional 3,00,000 jobs when we consider indirect jobs. As Apple plans to move half of its supply chain to India from China, Apple plans to create 5,00,000 direct jobs
As it continues to distance itself from China and invest in India, Apple plans to relocate at least half of its existing supply chain from China to India over the next three years. In the process, Apple, will also significantly increase the jobs that it offers in India.
As per a report by the Economic Times, Apple aims to employ at least 5,00,000 people directly in India’s ecosystem of component makers and suppliers, marking a substantial increase from the current level.
Currently, Apple is responsible for just about 1,50,000 blue-collar jobs in India, the highest by a single company.
The move away from China is part of Apple’s ongoing strategy to reduce its reliance on China and increase local value addition from its Indian suppliers. The strategy is famously called the China Plus One policy.
Among all countries, it is in China that Apple has the highest domestic value addition in the world, which is 28 per cent. The value-add in India currently is about 11-12 per cent which is expected to go up to 15-18 per cent.
Experts predict that India’s growing importance as a market for both exports and local sales of Apple products will catalyse a vibrant supplier ecosystem and potentially position the country as a hub for research and development for Apple, especially in software-to-silicon design.
Neil Shah, vice president at Counterpoint Research, noted that India’s current local value addition to iPhone manufacturing stands at 14%, compared to 41 per cent in China. However, with the right investments and expansion, Apple could increase this figure to over 20 per cent, as per the ET report.
Apple’s suppliers in India, include Tata Electronics, Salcomp Technologies, Foxlink, and Sunwoda. All of these companies have emerged as top job creators, with estimates suggesting that at least 1,50,000 direct jobs and an additional 3,00,000 indirect jobs were created since the production-linked incentive or PLI was introduced in August 2021.
Contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron, which produce iPhones in India, have also significantly contributed to job creation in the country.
Last year, these manufacturers collectively created over 77,000 direct jobs, and have plans to hire more than 10,000 additional employees during peak production periods.
Apple’s increased focus on manufacturing in India is evident in its production numbers, with iPhones worth over â¹1 lakh crore produced in India in the previous year, a substantial increase from previous years. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, highlighted the company’s strong performance in emerging markets, including India, during the recent earnings call, emphasizing robust double-digit growth and record-breaking sales figures in several countries.

Apple sent a fresh batch of threat notifications to users in 92 countries, including India, on April 10, warning them that they may have been individually targeted by a ""mercenary spyware attack"" attempting to remotely compromise their iPhone.
In the notification, a copy of which has been viewed byMoneycontrol, Apple notes that mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware.
""These attacks cost millions of dollars and are individually deployed against a very small number of people, but the targeting is ongoing and global...This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do."" it said.
""The extreme cost, sophistication, and worldwide nature makes mercenary spyware attacks some of the most advanced digital threats in existence today. As a result, Apple does not attribute the attacks or the notice you’re receiving to any specific attackers or geographical regions,"" the notification read.
Apple said it relies solely on ""internal threat-intelligence information and investigations to detect such attacks"".
""Although our investigations can never achieve absolute certainty, Apple threat notifications are high-confidence alerts that a user has been individually targeted by a mercenary spyware attack and should be taken very seriously"" the company said on its website.
Since 2021, the iPhone maker has notified users in over 150 countries after the company started sending threat notifications to users. Apple declined to comment on this development toMoneycontrol.
The notification also outlines various steps and recommended actions for users affected by this spyware attack. This includes enabling lockdown mode, which the company claims offers the ""strongest protection for users,"" updating their iPhone and other Apple devices to the latest software version, updating their messaging and cloud apps to the latest available versions, and enlisting expert help.
""Public reporting and research has shown that mercenary spyware attacks target users across modern computing platforms, including iOS and Safari as well as Google Android, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Windows, as well as a variety of messaging and cloud apps including iMessage and WhatsApp,"" the notification read.
""If your device is compromised by a targeted mercenary spyware attack, the attacker may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone,"" it added.
Apple has also updated the threat notification support page on its website, dropping the reference for attacks as 'state-sponsored', instead referring to them as 'mercenary spyware attacks'
""We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behaviour to evade detection in the future"" the company said.
This move comes after the iPhone maker was caught in a political firestorm in India in October 2023.
Severalpoliticians from opposition parties, including TMC's Mahua Moitra, Shiv Sena (UBT's) Priyanka Chaturvedi, Congress' Pawan Khera and Shashi Tharoor, AAP's Raghav Chadha, and CPIM's Sitaram Yechury, said that they had received notifications from Apple warning them that their devices were being targeted by state-sponsored attackers.
Observer Research Foundation (ORF) president Samir Saran, as well as journalists Siddharth Vardarajan and Sriram Karri, also said that they had received similar notifications from Apple.
On November 2,Moneycontrolreported that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) hadsent a notice to Appleregarding threat notifications. IT secretary S Krishnan had also said that Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) is investigating the matter.
Apple was alsosending its technical and cybersecurity expertsto the country to meet with officials investigating the matter,Moneycontrolreported on November 9.

An Apple Home Robot? Why It Could Be a Tough Sell,"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission.How we test phones
Commentary: Apple may have a lot to learn from the failed robots of years past.
An artist's conception of an Apple robot. (Note this image doesn't reflect a real product and isn't associated with Apple.)
Applealready makes devices that sit in our pockets, on ourwristsand atop ourdesks. Next, it may be coming for us in an even bigger way.
Apple is looking into the idea of developing a home robot,according to Bloomberg. The tech giant reportedly has two concepts in mind: a robot that can move around the home, and a tabletop robotic device. The report cautions that the robotics initiative is in early stages and may not lead to a final product.
Apple is far from being the first company to explore home robotics. But efforts to make the sci-fi trope of a robotic home butler a reality have largely fallen short for two big reasons: Such devices are usually expensive, and they also lack unique functionality that feels substantially different from existing technologies like phones, connected cameras and smart speakers.
Apple, being one of the world's most influential technology companies, has some major advantages that startups in the robotics space have lacked. But it still faces the daunting task of proving that robots deserve a place in the home.
Apple didn't respond to CNET's request for comment.

Apple's FaceTime app shown on an iPad.
Apple initially wanted to create an autonomous and rovingvideoconferencingrobot that could potentially also help with chores, according to Bloomberg. But the report described the housework functionality as a ""pie-in-the-sky"" idea rather than a feasible project, because of the engineering involved. Still, the idea sounds similar to Amazon's goals with its own Astro robot, which can serve as a mobile Alexa bot and security camera.
The second, tabletop idea is further along and less ambitious from an engineering standpoint, though Bloomberg says it's come and gone from Apple's product road map. Based on the report, it sounds like this would be a smart display that can move, similar toAmazon's Echo Show 10. Amazon's device can reposition its display and the built-in camera to keep users in frame during video calls and to view its surroundings when it's functioning as a home security camera.
Apple's idea reportedly involves having the smart display move in a way that mimics head movements, such as nodding, during FaceTime calls. It would also be able to focus on specific people during calls, Bloomberg reports, which sounds likeApple's Center Stage featurefor iPads.
Amazon's Astro is a lot more than an Echo Show on wheels.
Perhaps the biggest challenge when it comes to a home robot is that the market is unproven.
Amazon's Astro, which the company announced in September 2021, may be the most high-profile attempt to bring robots into the home. But more than two years later,it's still labeledas being part of Amazon's experimental Day 1 Editions program and requires an invite to purchase. It also costs $1,600, making it more expensive than an iPhone andiPadcombined, depending on the model.
Though Amazon has updated Astro with new features, like the ability to detect pets, and releaseda security-oriented version for businesses, the company hasn't said much else about the robot's future.
Smaller companies, without Amazon's and Apple's broad influence and deep resources, have also attempted to popularize home robots, to no avail. TakeJibo, a 2017-era robot that emerged just as voice-enabled smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home were picking up steam.
The creators behind Jibo tried to distinguish the bot by giving it an adorable personality, but its functionality was ultimately too limited compared with other home assistants. And at $899, Jibo was much pricier than most smart speakers -- many of which supported a lot more features and integrations.
The Jibo home robot.
Smart toy maker Anki made headlines in 2013 afterappearingin the keynote presentation at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference. The company impressed with its adorable, Pixar-likeCozmo robot STEM toyback in 2016, but the operationclosed its doorsin 2019 after a financial deal fell through, according to a Voxreportat the time.
Kuri, a similarly charismatic home companion, from a company called Mayfield Robotics, is another example of a digital helper that met an untimely end.
The Anki Cozmo robotic toy.
Taken together, the downfalls of Jibo, Anki and Kuri are cautionary tales that underscore the challenges companies face when bringing robotics into the home. While these robots felt fun, innovative and impressive in certain ways, they weren't practical enough to justify their high costs.
Apple also hasn't established as large a presence in the home as some of its rivals, which could make it difficult to commercialize a new product category in that area. Amazon's original Echo became a surprise hitfollowing its unveiling in late 2014, helping to create a new market for internet-connected speakers.
Now, almost a decade later, Amazon still holds the lead, with more than 45% of US smart speaker shipments in 2023, according to figures provided to CNET by the International Data Corporation. Apple by comparison places third, after Google.
Though developing a smart and capable robot at the right price remains a challenge, Apple does have some elements working in its favor. For one, judging from Bloomberg's report it sounds like Apple may already have some of the technology for a home robot in place, from its scrapped car project.
FaceTimeis also among the most well-known video calling apps, which could make an Apple personal robot more appealing. That's especially true for the potential tabletop robot mentioned in Bloomberg's report, which sounds like it would be designed for more-immersive FaceTime interactions. Apple also has a better reputation than many tech companies when it comes to personal privacy, a factor that could make customers feel more comfortable with a robotic presence in the home.
It's important to remember, too, that technology has come a long way since Jibo's, Anki's and Kuri's short-lived time in the spotlight. Advancements inartificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, could make new home robots much more capable and clever, possibly helping them carry out more-natural conversations and perform tasks on our behalf more efficiently.
There's been a lot of speculation about Apple chasing its next iPhone moment with new products like theVision Proheadset. The robot, according to Bloomberg, would likely be another such attempt.
But asI wrote last year, don't expect Apple's next iPhone moment to look like the original iPhone moment in 2007. The world is simply too different now, and Apple's biggest hits in recent years have felt more like slow burns than overnight successes. Just look at the way the Apple Watch helped popularize health and fitness tracking, and how AirPods changed the headphone industry. Those products had a gradual impact on how we use technology.
If Apple does develop a home robot, I imagine the company will position the product in a way that's similar to how it's touting the Vision Pro: by calling it a new type of computer. Perhaps one that combines the best aspects of your iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and iPhone and can move all by itself."

Apple will open the iPhone to repair with used parts,"ByEmma Roth,a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.
Apple is finally making it easier for users to repair their iPhones with used parts. Inan update on Thursday, the company announced that this fall, owners of “select” iPhone models will be able to repair their devices with used, genuine parts while retaining full functionality.
When repairing a phone, Apple requires iPhone users to go througha process called parts pairing, which makes them match the serial number of their device to that of a new part sold by Apple. If a user replaced a part with an aftermarket or used component, the iPhone would display pesky notifications saying that Apple isn’t able to verify the newly installed piece. In the case of Face ID and Touch ID sensors, the partmight not workat all.
This change should do away with these notifications for used parts, as Apple says “calibration for genuine Apple parts, new or used, will happen on device after the part is installed.” It also means users and repair shops will no longer have to provide the serial number of the device they’re fixing when ordering most parts from the Self Service Repair Store.
The change will apply to displays, batteries, and cameras at launch. Apple says “future” iPhone releases will come with support for used biometric sensors, such as Face ID or Touch ID.
At the same time, Apple is also getting more serious about tracking used iPhone components. The company announced that it will extend itsActivation Lock feature, which is supposed to prevent thieves from using a device that’s lost or stolen, to iPhone parts. “If a device under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled, calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted,” Apple says.
If you do end up repairing your iPhone with a used part, the device will store that information in the Parts and Service History section of the Settings app on iOS. Apple doesn’t specify which iPhone models will be supported this fall, but the companytoldTechCrunchit will be the iPhone 15 and later.
“With this latest expansion to our repair program, we’re excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts,” John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering, says in a statement.
Even though Apple still hasn’t extended its approval to aftermarket iPhone parts, the change is huge for repair shops and DIYers who have had to deal with paying a higher premium for new iPhone parts.

Apple is expected to notify users in India and 91 other countries about a potential “mercenary spyware” attack attempt on their devices, as per a report published byThe Economic Timeson Thursday. The attack, detected by Apple, was reporterdly aimed at gaining unlawful access to iPhones.
Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those involving Pegasus from the NSO Group, are considered exceptionally rare and sophisticated compared to regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware, according to a threat notification mail by Apple.
In the notification, Apple informs users that their devices are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack attempting to remotely compromise their iPhones associated with a specific Apple ID. The company urges users to take the warning seriously, as these attacks are likely targeting individuals based on who they are or what they do.
Apple has updated its support page to provide tips for users who may have been targeted by the mercenary spyware attack. The threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted by such attacks.

This is the second round of threat notifications sent by Apple globally. In October 2023, Apple sent similar notifications to users in several countries, including India, warningthem of a “state-sponsored” attackon their devices.

Apple issues fresh ‘mercenary spyware’ attack notifications in India,"Apple has sent fresh threat notifications to its users in 92 countries including India. The threat notification warns users that their iPhone could have been potentially attacked by “mercenary spyware,” The company has not attributed recent attacks to any stakeholder.
Apple sent out threat notification emails to impacted users in India on Thursday (April 11) at around 12:30 am IST. It is uncertain how many individuals received the alert from Apple. The email highlights the use of NSO-Group's Pegasus spyware to target people globally on an ongoing basis.
For the unversed, Apple, last October, also warned several Opposition leaders, including Congress'sShashi Tharoor, AAP's Raghav Chadha, and TMC's Mahua Moitra about a potential state-sponsored spyware attack on their iPhones. Under pressure from the government, Apple later clarified that it does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker.
New threat notifications were accessed by Indian Express. According to the publication, the subject line of the notification reads, “ALERT: Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone.”
The company has advised users to be cautious while clicking on links they receive. It is recommended not to open any links or attachments from unknown or unexpected senders. However, the company refrained from providing more information about the cause of the threat notification. It stated that doing so could help the mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behaviour and evade detection in the future.
Apple has also updated its support page to provide tips for users who may have been targets of the mercenary spyware attack. “Apple threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks, likely because of who they are or what they do,” said the iPhone maker.

Appleproduced $14 billion worth of iPhones in India over the last fiscal year, a sign of the company's continued effort to manufacture more devices outside of China, a report fromBloombergsaid Wednesday.
As relations between the U.S. and China havesoured, Apple has worked to diversify its supply chain by expanding production in countries likeVietnamand India. It's a big shift for the iPhone maker, which has historically relied on China for manufacturing.
Apple now makes around 1 in 7, or 14%, of its iPhones in India,twice the amountit produced there last year, the report said. The manufacturer Pegatron assembled around 17% of those iPhones, while Foxconn produced around 67%, according to the report. Wistron built the rest.
In June 2023, Apple CEOTim Cookand other tech executives met with India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, at the White House. Cooktold CNBCafter the meeting that India represents a ""huge opportunity."" Apple opened its firstretail storesin the country last year.
China remains a crucial market for Apple, but sales have been off to a rocky start this year. A Counterpoint Researchreportfrom March found that iPhone sales in China dropped 24% in the first six weeks of 2024. The firm said Apple faces significant competition from other smartphone vendors like Huawei.
Apple declined to comment.

Apple to introduce new Safari browser assistant for iPhones with iOS 18,"Listen to Story
iPhone fans are eagerly awaiting the new OS update, iOS 18. Why? Well, the new iOS iteration is said to be the biggest ever software upgrade Apple is bringing for its iPhones with daily leaks continuing to fuel speculation about the new features. The latest buzz suggests Apple might introduce a dedicated Safari browsing assistant for iPhones with iOS 18, further amping up the excitement.
According to tipster Nicolás lvarez's recent discovery in Apple's backend code, iOS 18 may feature a new Safari browsing assistant. lvarez, in his recent post on X, reveals that ""Coming in iOS 18: - 'Safari browsing assistant' - 'Encrypted visual search.' Both features seem to use the Private Relay infrastructure to send data to Apple (so that they don't know your IP?)."" The presence of the new assistant was also verified by Aaron Perris from MacRumors, but more details on how the feature will work are not yet available.
Interestingly, the hint at the integration of a browsing assistant in Safari is in line with ongoing speculations about new generative AI features slated for release on the iPhone with iOS 18. If it's true, the AI assistance will be similar to the feature. It's worth noting that AI capabilities are already present in several, such as Microsoft Edge, which includes a Copilot feature powered by GPT-4 and Arc Search.
In addition, lvarez spotted a function named ""Encrypted Visual Search"" in the code, but its specifics are still unclear.
Apart from the rumoured AI assistant improvements, iOS 18 is expected to bring several significant updates. We can anticipate AI integration across various iOS applications.
For example, Apple Music might curate personalised playlists based on your listening habits, while stock apps like Mail and Notes could gain AI-powered features for improved functionality. Siri, once sluggish, is set for a substantial upgrade with the integration of large language models (LLMs). This will transform it into a comprehensive ""ultimate virtual assistant"" with improved conversational capabilities and deeper Shortcuts integration.
iPhone users might finally be able to ditch the limitations of iMessage and enjoy features like enhanced video quality and read receipts when messaging Android users through rumoured RCS support. iOS 18 might also  grant you more control over the home screen just like an Android phone. Speculations suggest the ability to create blank spaces and customise icon arrangements for a truly personalised experience.
Apple might introduce ""Adaptive Voice Shortcuts"" and potentially allow adjustable font sizes across more apps with iOS 18. The AirPods Pro could even gain functionality similar to hearing aids. Apple Maps might become more competitive with features like custom route planning and potentially the addition of topographic maps for outdoor enthusiasts.
While Apple hasn't officially confirmed which iPhones will support iOS 18, rumours suggest a wide range of devices, including many models from 2018 and later, could be eligible. This could potentially include the iPhone XS and XR, although that remains uncertain.
It's important to note that all these features are speculative. We expect more information about these developments to emerge in the coming weeks leading up to WWDC 2024, which will be held from June 10 to 14.Published By:Divya BhatiPublished On:Apr 11, 2024Also Read |iQoo Z9 Turbo launching in China with Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC, India launch expected soonAlso Read |Nothing Ear, Ear a to launch in India on April 18: Yellow colour variant, India price, and moreAlso Read |Google is bringing its AI photo editing features for both Android and iPhone users for free"
Apple stock sentiment improving says JPMorgan as AI could help re-rating,"Despite the broader market's rally, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has faced challenges this year, with its year-to-date performance reflecting a downward trend at -10.35% year-to-date.
This decline in Apple's stock value has occurred even as theS&P 500experienced a notable uptick. However, amidst this backdrop, there is a glimmer of optimism as JPMorgan recently indicated that the sentiment surrounding Apple's stock is showing signs of improvement.
Moreover, JPMorgan underscored the potential of AI, a game-changing technology, to re-rate Apple's stock, potentially leading to a significant turnaround.
JPMorgan analysts said in a note Thursday that sentiment towards Apple is improving with hedge fund investors despite deteriorating data points.
“Contrary to the deterioration of fundamentals relative to both hardware demand as well as outlook for services growth, the interest in AAPL shares have improved from the broader group of investors who have otherwise been averse to the premium valuation multiple despite one of the lowest growth outlooks relative to the other mega cap tech stocks,” wrote the investment bank.
The bank explained the drivers of the increase in enthusiasm for Apple are the fact that the valuation premium is moderating following the Apple stock decline, and the artificial intelligence-led iPhone upgrade cycle.
“The increasing appetite from investors has largely been driven by interest in participating in the cyclical upsides associated with the AI on-device led upgrade cycle, with investors taking the cue from the 5G led upgrade cycle,” added JPMorgan.
The bank highlighted various Apple headwinds, such as iPhone sales data points, including demand in China, the cancellation of the future opportunity around Automotive revenues, and the downside risks to Services on account of higher regulatory scrutiny in multiple geographies.
However, they state that at the same time, hedge funds are eyeing the headwinds to create more tactical entry points ahead of the AI upgrade cycle.
The firm sees some similarities with the 5G cycle. For example, hardware adoption potentially running ahead of the consumer understanding of the use cases and is driven more by expectations of robust use cases, “even though the asked questions today are about the AI use cases.” In addition, the replacement cycle being temporarily accelerated for two to three years on account of the upgrade cycle and the lack of backward compatibility. For example, 5G capability could not be activated on prior generation 4G phones, while JPMorgan expects the absence of AI feature availability on older phones.
Elsewhere, BofA said in a recent note that investors have significantly underestimated Apple’s gross margins.
In its analysis, the bank said the Street was modeling FY23 gross margins for Apple at39% but in reality, Apple printed 44% gross margins, “significantly exceeding (500bps)original expectations.”
“In our opinion, the Street continues to underestimate the long-term gross margin potential for Apple across both products and Services yet again, where we see about 180bps of Product gross margin upside and about 150bps of Services margins upside over the next few years,” they wrote."

Technology companyAppleon Thursday warned some users in India and 91 other countries that their iPhones may have been targeted by “mercenary spyware”, including the controversial Pegasus software,The Indian Expressreported.
The company sent the emails to users in India around 12.30 am Indian Standard Time. It is unclear how many people received the warning.
The technology company has sent out similar notifications warning users of an attack several times since 2021. In October, Apple had warned several Indian Opposition leaders and at least four journalists that it believed that their iPhones may have beentargetedby “state-sponsored attackers”.
However, in a subsequentclarification, the company said that it did not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker.
The threat notification in the early hours of Thursday did not attribute the suspected attacks to any stakeholder.
According toThe Indian Express, the subject line on the email said: “ALERT: Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone.”
The notification further said: “Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-…This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do.”
The company also said that tools such as Pegasus were being used to target individuals globally.
The Pegasus spyware is licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli cyber intelligence companyNSO Group. The company insists that it sells its software only to “vetted governments” with good human rights records and that it is intended to target criminals.
However, in July 2021, a consortium of international media organisations had reported that Pegasus was being used by governments around the world to snoop on critics.
Apple’s email notification on Thursday said thatmercenary spyware attackssuch as those using Pegasus were “exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware”, theEconomic Timesreported.
“These attacks cost millions of dollars and are individually deployed against a very small number of people, but the targeting is ongoing and global,” it said.
The technology company warned its users not to open links or attachments from unexpected or unknown senders.
In October,Opposition leaders, including the Congress’ Shashi Tharoor, TS Singhdeo, Revanth Reddy, Pawan Khera and Supriya Shrinate, Aam Aadmi Party’s Raghav Chadha and Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav had received messages from the firm saying that “state-sponsored attackers” were trying to compromise their devices.
Besides the Opposition leaders, at least five journalists had also received the message.
In its alert, Apple had warned that “if your device is compromised by a state-sponsored attacker, they may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone”. The notification added: “While it’s possible this is a false alarm, please take this warning seriously.”
However, the company later clarified that it did not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker.AnApple spokesperson had said that the company was not specifically saying that the Indian government was responsible for these attacks, but added that it did not rule out the possibility."
Will Virtual Card Numbers Spark a Rush to Spend Apple Cash?,"For Apple — and as been seen already with Block (formerly Square) — the drive is to get consumers to spend the cash, rather than just bank it.
Apple, of course, has been forging an ecosystem that includes financial services, where Apple Cash serves as a linchpin. The cash card is built into Apple devices, is housed in the online wallet and acts as both a peer-to-peer (P2P) money service and as a way to shop online and in brick-and-mortar locations.
The card was originally designed to work wherever Apple Pay was accepted, and holders of the Apple Card have been able to save their “daily cash” in a savings account (indications last yearwere that users had deposited$10 billion), and to use Apple Cash to move money between those accounts.
Now the ecosystem is broadening a bit.As reported this week, Apple Cash cards now have virtual card numbers, enabling users to securely spend their Apple Cash at merchants that don’t accept Apple Pay.
In looking at the company’s latest annual filings, there are no details about the uptake of the cards or the use of Apple Cash. Much of the information has been qualitative — as management has highlighted double digitgrowth in transacting accounts.Apple Cash, originally Apple Pay Cash, debuted in 2017.
Through the past several years, and as discussed in arecent column by Karen Webster(illuminating her own use of Apple Pay), the digital wallets and digital cards have evolved to a current state wherein “consumers seem to want to manage the everyday transactional parts of their lives — how they pay, who they pay, how much they spend, and how much they have left to spend. It’s one of the reasons so many consumers gravitate to the everyday app concept.”
The one-stop shop experience, from Apple’s vantage point, has been furthered byan announcement last month: The tech behemoth unveiled an application programming interface (API) enabling users to see their balances on their Apple finance products across Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings with Apple.
Given the fact that, as PYMNTS Intelligence has shown, 54% of Apple Pay Users earn more than $100,000 a year and the company has hadroughly 50% share of mobile wallets, the ability to use Apple Cash to spend at merchants who don’t accept Apple pay offers further monetization potential throughout the ecosystem.
Using Apple Pay to access Apple Cash and using virtual cards, altogether, to create a financial platform of sorts spanning a continuum of activity has some analog, chiefly in the form of Block’s ecosystem. That ecosystem is also linked across apps, cards, P2P payments and savings.
Block noted inits own fourth quarter resultsthat as of December there were 2 million actives (3% of the total active consumer installed base) depositing their paychecks into Cash App each month. There were 23 million Cash App Card monthly actives.
“In the same way that peer-to-peer payments was a gateway to the Cash App Card, we see the Cash App Card as a gateway to our customers adopting Cash App as a primary banking solution,” CEO Jack Dorsey said in the latest investor letter.
Cash App Card actives who deposit at least $2,000 of paychecks per month spend nearly 6 times more than Cash App Card actives who do not deposit a paycheck with Cash App, the results said.
In terms of demographics, Cash App’s “base is largely made up of customers with a household income of less than $100,000 per year, and “longer term we see an opportunity to serve customers with a household income of up to $150,000 per year,” Dorsey noted. Cash App Pay logged $2.5 billion in annualized GPV last year.
Apple’s moved a long way from the Apple I computer that helped launch a digital revolution in home nearly 50 years ago. Now it wants to see if it can launch a digital evolution in the palm of one’s hand, at merchants who accept Apple Pay — and those who don’t.

We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors."
"Apple doubles iPhone production in India, diversifying beyond China","Feedback
Apple doubled its iPhone assembly in India to $14 billion last fiscal year, indicating a move to diversify beyond China, according to a report by Bloomberg. Reports suggest that around 14 per cent of Apple's flagship devices are now made in India. This increase is seen as an attempt by the tech giant to reduce its reliance on China amidst growing geopolitical tensions.
Despite this, China remains Apple's largest iPhone production hub and biggest overseas market. However, Apple's revenues in China are reportedly declining due to rising competition from rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. and an increasing ban on foreign technology use in workplaces.
This surge in Indian manufacturing is a victory for the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has offered financial incentives to foreign companies, including Apple, to attract high-end manufacturing. According to the government, this has resulted in the creation of 150,000 direct jobs at Apple's suppliers. Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. assembled nearly 67 per cent and 17 per cent of the India-made iPhones respectively in the fiscal year ending March 2024.
The rest were made in Wistron Corp.'s plant in Karnataka, which was taken over by Tata Group last year. Tata plans to establish one of the largest iPhone assembly plants in the country. The $14 billion figure refers to the estimated value of the devices as they leave the factory, not their retail price. Apple representatives declined to comment.

Apple issues threat alerts to iPhone users amidst rising spyware attacks,"In a recent development, Apple has issued cautionary alerts to its users in response to a surge in spyware attacks targeting iPhone users. The tech giant, on April 10, acknowledged the persistent threat of spyware attacks and commenced sending out threat notifications to its customer base.
Apple has shed light on the peril posed by mercenary spyware, notably exemplified by tools like Pegasus from the NSO Group. This spyware, often deployed by hired entities, has been identified as a significant security risk for Apple users. Notably, these attacks have manifested in various forms, including the disruption of wired connections to peripherals even when the device is locked. Additionally, the spyware configuration encompasses the creation of profiles and the evasion of detection through Mobile Device Management (MDM) when Lockdown Mode is activated.
In response to the escalating threat landscape, Apple has reaffirmed its commitment to enhancing security measures for its users. The company has reiterated its efforts to fortify lockdown mode and implement additional safeguards progressively.
The recent spate of spyware attacks targeting Apple users has raised concerns about the involvement of state-sponsored entities. These well-funded attackers leverage sophisticated techniques to remotely compromise iPhones, making detection and mitigation challenging. The incidence of such attacks has been reported across multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of the threat.
Apple has underscored the importance of vigilance among its user base and provided guidance on identifying potential threats.
In India, on October 31, 2023, many political leaders received an alert from Apple. Apple said that they have been sending such threat notifications since 2021.

Apple assembles 14% of iPhones in India during FY24,"NEW DELHI: In a significant development for the domestic mobile manufacturing sector, US tech giant Apple reportedly assembled $14 billion worth iPhones in India during financial year 2023-2024.
This constitutes 14% of Apple’s global iPhone production, meaning one in seven of its devices are now manufactured in the country.
The move reflects Apple’s strategy to diversify its production base away from China due to geopolitical tensions between the US and the world’s second largest economy.
Last year, commerce minister Piyush Goyal mentioned that Apple would start 25% of the total iPhone production in India by 2025. The company began manufacturing iPhones in India in 2017 and has since scaled up production. Currently, Apple is assembling iPhones ranging from the legacy 12 to its latest iPhone 15 in the country, but not the higher-spec Pro and Pro Max models.
In India, the iPhone is manufactured by three contract manufacturers: Foxconn, Pegatron Corp., and Tata Group (formerly Wistron Corp.). According to the report, Foxconn is the biggest manufacturer as it assembles nearly 67%, while Pegatron Corp. makes about 17% of the India-made iPhones.
The surge in production also means that Apple will increase exports from India. According to the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association, India’s mobile phone exports are expected to cross `1.2 lakh crore at the end of this financial year, led by Apple and Samsung. Now, mobile phones have become India’s fifth-largest export as an individual commodity.
Last year, India’s conglomerate Tata Group acquired Taiwan’s Wistron plant in Karnataka. The company is also in talks to take control of another iPhone manufacturing facility owned by Pegatron in the country.
Tata plans to hold at least a 65% stake in a joint venture that will operate the Pegatron plant near Chennai. Tata, one of the largest conglomerates in India, will operate the joint venture through its Tata Electronics unit.

"Apple Warns iPhone Users in 92 Countries, Including India, of ‘Mercenary Spyware Attacks’","New Delhi: Apple on Thursday issue another alertin 92 countrieswarning its iPhone users of “mercenary spyware attacks”. Though it did not disclose the attackers’ identities, the malware could be the type associated withIsraeli NSO Group’scontroversial Pegasus,which was earlier found to have infected several users in India.
“Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,” it wrote in the warning to affected customers, according toTechCrunch.
The Apple text added: “This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously,” saidTechCrunch,which reviewed the copy.
According to Apple’s support page, such notifications several times in a year to its iPhone users across the globe.
However, the warning by Apple has raised an alarm in India, more so as it comes once againafter a gap of six months andat a time when the country is in the midst of general elections.
In October 2023,Apple had senta warning on “State-sponsored attackers trying to remotely compromise” iPhones belonging to a number of journalists and Opposition politicians in India, with many of them tweeting the screenshots of the alerts.
Among those who got the alert wereMahua Moitra of Trinamool Congress, Priyanka Chaturvedi of Shiv Sena (UBT), Shashi Tharoor of Congress, Sitaram Yechury of CPI(M), Akhilesh Yadav of Samajwadi Party and senior journalists Siddharth Varadarajan and Sriram Karri among others.
""Apple believes you are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers who are trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID. These attackers are likely targeting you individually because of who you are or what you do. If your device is compromised by a state-sponsored attacker, they may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone. While it's possible this is a false alarm, please take this warning seriously,"" the October 2023 alert had stated.
In December 2023,Amnesty International had reported that it had found Pegasus spyware on the phones of some Indian journalists.
“Our latest findings show that increasingly, journalists in India face the threat of unlawful surveillance simply for doing their jobs, alongside other tools of repression including imprisonment under draconian laws, smear campaigns, harassment, and intimidation,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, Head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab, in the blog post in December.
The Narendra Modi government is yet to come out with a full disclosure, as it has neither denied nor confirmed using the Pegasus tool (which is a government-to- government purchase) in the Supreme Court.

Tech giant Apple on Thursday sent threat notifications to select users in 92 countries, including some in India, who may have been targeted using ‘mercenary spyware’ like Pegasus from the NSO Group.
Mercenary spyware attacks are exceptionally well-funded and they evolve over time.
According to an Apple support document, it relies solely on internal threat-Intelligence information and investigations to detect such attacks.

The company, however, did not officially comment on threat notifications being sent to targeted users.
Since 2021, the company has sent threat notifications multiple times a year as it detected these attacks, and to date, “we have notified users in over 150 countries in total,” according to the company’s support document.
The extreme cost, sophistication, and worldwide nature of mercenary spyware attacks makes them some of the most advanced digital threats in existence today.
Recently, the Indian government warned Apple users in India about multiple vulnerabilities in their devices.
CERT-In, under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, said that multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Apple Products which “could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, bypass security restrictions, disclose sensitive information, gain elevated privileges or cause denial of service conditions on the target system.”
The national cyber-security agency had asked Apple users to upgrade their iOS software with the latest company updates.

The US Department of State reiterated on Wednesday its commitment to conduct a full investigation into the alleged foiled assassination plot against India designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun and said that they have made it clear to the Indian government to do the same.
Apple CEO, Tim Cook on Monday extended Holi wishes. Cook, who shared the greetings on X, added a picture showcasing the festival's vibrant colour and joy, shot on the iPhone.
The US Justice Department and 16 states on Thursday accused tech giant Apple of using exclusionary business practices to sustain the monopoly of its flagship product, the iPhone.

Apple finally supports used parts for iPhone repairs,"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission.Learn more.
Published on5 hours ago

Applehas long taken an aggressive approach to iPhone repairs, as it uses parts pairing practices to discourage repairs by independent stores. That’s changing today, as the company has just announced support for used parts in repairs.
Applesaidit would allow customers and independent stores to utilize used parts in iPhone repairs, starting with “select” iPhone models this fall (ostensibly theiPhone 16 series).
The company said it would launch an overhauled parts calibration process in the fall. This process applies to new and used iPhone parts and takes place on the device after the part is installed. Apple added that future iPhones will enable support for used biometric sensors (e.g. Touch ID, Face ID). Furthermore, customers and independent repair outlets will no longer have to provide a phone’s serial number when ordering parts for repairs unrelated to the logic board.
The Cupertino colossus also explained how it would prevent stolen iPhones from being used for repairs:
Apple added that it would also update its Parts and Service History page in iOS to show whether a part is new or second-hand.
Apple’s support for second-hand parts comes after a long-running fight against the right-to-repair movement, with several US states and the European Union issuing right-to-repair legislation. One of the most infamous anti-repair practices was Apple’s aforementioned parts pairing process, which allowed the company to track and control how the part was used. The company went so far as to show fear-mongering messages on iPhones about the display or battery not being genuine if the parts weren’t blessed by Apple. iPhone owners were even forced to get their biometric sensors fixed by Apple itself as second-hand sensors didn’t work. The company did, however, launch aself-repair programin 2022.
"
Apple Confirms Innovative iPhone 16 Pro Upgrade,"It may be the latest buzzword on Android, but Apple’s iPhone is not seen as an AI-infused smartphone. That’s set to change, and we now know one way in which Tim Cook and his team plan to catch up.
Experiencing the iPhone 15 during a launch event (Photo by Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images)
The details come in a newly released research paper by researchers from Cornell University working with Apple. Titled ""Ferret-UI: Grounded Mobile UI Understanding with Multimodal LLMs,” it details a multimodal large language model that can be used to understand what is displayed on a screen, specifically the elements in a mobile user interface, such as the display of an iPhone.
Thanks to a large supply of training data, it is possible to pick out icons, find text, parse widgets, describe in text what is on screen, parse the interface elements, and interact with the display while being guided by open-ended instructions and prompts.
Ferret was released in October 2023 and designed to parse photos and images to recognise what was on show. This upgrade to the snappily titled Ferret-UI will offer several benefits to those using it with their iPhone and could easily fit into an improved AI-powered Siri.
Being able to describe the screen, no matter the app, opens up a richer avenue for accessibility apps, removing the need to pre-program responses and actions. Those looking to perform complex tasks or find obscure options on their phone could ask Siri to open up a complex app and use an obscure function hidden away in the depths of the menu system.
Developers could use Ferret-UI as a testing tool, asking the MLMM to act as if it was a 14-year-old with little experience with social networks to perform tasks or simulate a 75-year-old user trying to connect to Facetime with their grandchildren.
Google publicly started the rush for AI-first smartphones on October 4th, a little more than three weeks after the launch of the iPhone 15. Tim Cook and his team did not make any noticeable announcements or draw attention to the AI improvements tucked away in its photo processing or text auto-correction, giving Android a head-start on AI and allowing Google’s mobile platform to set expectations.
Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference takes place in June, and it will be the first moment Apple can engage with the public to discuss its AI plans as it lays the foundations for the launch of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro in September.
Until then, we have the academic side of Apple’s AI approach to be going on with.
Now read why the iPhone’s approach to AI is disrupting the specs for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus...

"Apple warns users in 91 countries, including India, of Pegasus-like ‘mercenary spyware’ attacks","iPhone maker Apple has issued a series of fresh notifications to users in 91 other countries, including India, cautioning them of ‘mercenary spyware’ including Pegasus malware that has stirred up significant controversy in recent times.
These new alerts, also received by users in India, are part of cautionary measures warning owners about potential risks to their privacy and data security.
In October 2023, Apple had sent a similar notification to political leaders across various parties in the country, including Congress’s Shashi Tharoor, Aam Aadmi Party’s Raghav Chadha, and Trinamool Congress’ Mahua Moitra. The alert warned of a “potential state-sponsored spyware attack” targeting their iPhones.
In 2021, the Supreme Court had formed a committee of technical experts to look into allegations of unauthorised surveillance using the Pegasus software developed by Israeli firm NSO Group.
In August 2022, the Supreme Court-appointed committee concluded that the spyware was not found in the 29 mobile phones examined by it, but malware was found in five mobile phones.
Apple noted that according to public reporting and research by civil society organisations, technology firms and journalists, individually targeted attacks of such exceptional cost and complexity have historically been associated with state actors, including private companies developing mercenary spyware on their behalf, such as Pegasus from the NSO Group.
It said, though deployed against a very small number of individuals – often journalists, activists, politicians and diplomats – mercenary spyware attacks are ongoing and global.
Since 2021, Apple said that it has sent out threat notifications multiple times a year as it has detected these attacks, and to date the company has notified users in over 150 countries in total.
“The extreme cost, sophistication and worldwide nature of mercenary spyware attacks makes them some of the most advanced digital threats in existence today. As a result, Apple does not attribute the attacks or resulting threat notifications to any specific attackers or geographical regions,” it said.
The phone maker in its notification provides additional steps that users can take to help protect their devices, including enabling Lockdown Mode.
Apple advised its users to update their devices with the latest security patches and exercise caution while interacting with suspicious links or messages. (ANI)

Mercenary spyware: Apple says iPhone users in India and 91 other countries were likely victims of a spyware,"Listen to Story
Apple recently sent out warnings to iPhone users in India and 91 other countries. The company informed users saying that their iPhones might be under attack by a type of spyware called ""mercenary spyware,"" including one called Pegasus made by a company called NSO Group in Israel.  Last October, they sent similar warnings to politicians from different parties in India, suggesting a possible state-sponsored spyware attack on their iPhones. However, Apple later said they couldn't pinpoint any specific attacker.
According to an Indian Express report.These warnings came without blaming anyone for the attacks. The warning emails were sent out around 12:30 am IST on a Thursday. It's not clear how many people got them. The emails mentioned Pegasus spyware and said that similar tools are being used globally to target people.
The subject line of the email read ""ALERT: Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone."" Apple explained in the email that these attacks are rare and very sophisticated, costing lots of money and targeting only a few people. They advised users to be careful with links and attachments from unknown senders.
“Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-. This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously,” the email read.
“Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware. These attacks cost millions of dollars and are individually deployed against a very small number of people, but the targeting is ongoing and global,” Apple said in its threat notification.
Apple couldn't give more details about why they sent the warnings because it might help the attackers avoid detection. They updated their support page to help users who might be targeted.
Apple started sending these warnings in 2021, and people from 150 countries have received them. Last year, at least 20 Indians with iPhones got these warnings too.
Previous investigations into similar issues haven't had much success. In 2021, the Supreme Court in India formed a committee to look into allegations of illegal surveillance using Pegasus. However, they didn't find clear evidence, partly because the government didn't cooperate.Overall, Apple wants its users to be aware of the risks of such attacks and stay safe online.Published By:Ankita ChakravartiPublished On:Apr 11, 2024Must Watch"
Apple to expand repair options with support for used genuine parts,"Text of this article
April 11, 2024
UPDATE
Apple to expand repair options with support for used genuine parts
New parts calibration process will begin this fall; Activation Lock to limit use of parts from lost or stolen devices
Today Apple announced an upcoming enhancement to existing repair processes that will enable customers and independent repair providers to utilize used Apple parts in repairs. Beginning with select iPhone models this fall, the new process is designed to maintain an iPhone user’s privacy, security, and safety, while offering consumers more options, increasing product longevity, and minimizing the environmental impact of a repair. Used genuine Apple parts will now benefit from the full functionality and security afforded by the original factory calibration, just like new genuine Apple parts.
“At Apple, we’re always looking for new ways to deliver the best possible experience for our customers while reducing the impact we have on the planet, and a key part of that means designing products that last,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “For the last two years, teams across Apple have been innovating on product design and manufacturing to support repairs with used Apple parts that won’t compromise users’ safety, security, or privacy. With this latest expansion to our repair program, we’re excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.”
The process of confirming whether or not a repair part is genuine and gathering information about the part — often referred to as “pairing” — is critical to preserving the privacy, security, and safety of iPhone. Apple teams have been hard at work over the last two years to enable the reuse of parts such as biometric sensors used for Face ID or Touch ID, and beginning this fall, calibration for genuine Apple parts, new or used, will happen on device after the part is installed. In addition, future iPhone releases will have support for used biometric sensors. And in order to simplify the repair process, customers and service providers will no longer need to provide a device’s serial number when ordering parts from the Self Service Repair Store for repairs not involving replacement of the logic board.
Apple will also extend its popular Activation Lock feature to iPhone parts in order to deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts. Requested by customers and law enforcement officials, the feature was designed to limit iPhone theft by blocking a lost or stolen iPhone from being reactivated. If a device under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled, calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted.
As device longevity increases, Apple believes it’s important that a device’s second or third owners have access to its full part and repair histories. With Parts and Service history, located within Settings on iOS, Apple is the only smartphone company that transparently shows owners whether their device has been repaired and provides information about the parts used. This fall, Apple will expand Parts and Service History to additionally show whether a part is a new or used genuine Apple part.
This upcoming enhancement to Apple’s repair processes is another step forward in the company’s commitment to improving access to safe and affordable repairs. In the last five years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training to more than 10,000 Independent Repair Providers and Apple Authorized Service Providers. For those who have the relevant experience repairing electronic devices, Self Service Repair gives access to the manuals, genuine Apple parts, and tools used at Apple Store and Apple Authorized Service Provider locations. Launched in 2022, Self Service Repair now supports 40 Apple products in 33 countries and regions, and 24 languages.

Apple Warns of iPhone 'Mercenary Spyware Attack' Across 92 Countries,"It's unclear whether people in the US were targeted.
Apple sent out iPhone security alerts to people across 92 countries on Wednesday, warning that their iPhones had been remotely targeted in a mercenary spyware attack.
""Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack,"" the company said in a threat notification email seen by CNET. ""This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do.""

Mercenary attacks, compared to cybercrimes or consumer malware, stand out due to their rarity and complexity. These meticulously orchestrated attacks cost millions of dollars and focus on a small number of people. The targeting is ongoing and global, the company said in the email.
""If your device is compromised by a targeted mercenary spyware attack, the attacker may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone,"" the threat notification email said.

The news was first reported by Indian business publicationThe Economic Times, which said that India is one of the affected countries. It's unclear whether iPhone owners in the US were targeted; an Apple spokesperson had no comment beyond what was shared in the notification email.
In a help page published Wednesday, the company offered advice on what to do if you receive a threat notification.
""We strongly suggest you enlist expert help, such as the rapid-response emergency security assistance provided by the Digital Security Helpline at the nonprofit Access Now. Apple threat notification recipients can contact the Digital Security Helpline 24 hours a day, seven days a weekthrough their website.""
The company also referenced Pegasus, sophisticated spyware developed by Israel's NSO group, when notifying people of the latest mercenary attack.
In November 2021,Apple filed a lawsuit against the NSO Groupto hold it accountable for surveillance and targeting of Apple users using Pegasus. This spyware had previously infected victims' devices, including iPhones, without tipping the user off. Since 2016, cyberwatchdogs have uncovered several instances of Pegasus being used by various entities to monitor journalists, lawyers, political dissidents and human rights activists.

The company said it sent the alerts to individuals in 92 nations at 12 p.m. Pacific Time Wednesday. The notification, which TechCrunch has seen, did not disclose the attackers’ identities or the countries where users received notifications.
“Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,” it wrote in the warning to affected customers.
“This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously,” Apple added in the text.
The iPhone maker sends these kind of notificationsmultiple times a yearand has notified users to such threats in over 150 countries since 2021, per an updated Applesupport page.
Apple also sent an identical warning to a number of journalists and politicians in India in October last year. Later, nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty Internationalreportedthat it had found Israeli spyware maker NSO Group’s invasive spyware Pegasus on the iPhones of prominent journalists in India. (Users in India are among those who have received Apple’s latest threat notifications, according to people familiar with the matter.)
The spyware alerts arrive at a time when many nations are preparing for elections. In recent months, many tech firms have cautioned about rising state-sponsored efforts to sway certain electoral outcomes. Apple’s alerts, however, did not remark on their timing.
“We are unable to provide more information about what caused us to send you this notification, as that may help mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future,” Apple told affected customers.
Applepreviouslydescribed the attackers as “state-sponsored” but has replaced all such references with “mercenary spyware attacks.”
The warning to customers adds: “Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware.”
Apple said it relies solely on “internal threat-intelligence information and investigations to detect such attacks.”
“Although our investigations can never achieve absolute certainty, Apple threat notifications are high-confidence alerts that a user has been individually targeted by a mercenary spyware attack and should be taken very seriously,” it added.

Apple Issues New Spyware Attack Warning To iPhone Users,"Apple has issued a new spyware warning to iPhone users in 92 countries, after it found they had been targeted in attacks. Apple users were alerted of the attacks via a notification email seen byReuters.
In India and 91 other countries, victims of thespyware attackwere informed that adversaries had attempted to “remotely compromise the iPhone.”
Apple has issued a new spyware warning to iPhone users in 92 countries, after it found they had been... [+]targeted in attacks.
“Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,” the alert reads.
“This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning—please take it seriously.”
The new iPhone attack apparently aimed to install the malicious software on the device to spy on a user’s data and location. Apple has sent these emails before, with multiple alerts going out to over 150 countries since 2021, according to the email sent out by the iPhone maker.
Apple did not disclose where the attack came from, but spyware attacks are typical of nation state actors. In 2021, Apple sued Israeli firm NSO Group for its part in attacks on iPhone users.
Over the last few years, Apple has issued an increasing number ofiOS updatesto address holes that could have been used for spyware attacks. Some of these come asemergency security updates, especially when an iPhone flaw is already being used in attacks.
Spyware attacks are scary because the malware can be delivered in a so-called zero-click attack which requires no interaction from an iPhone user. One example is a malicious image that can be sent over iMessage or WhatsApp.
If iPhone spyware attacks such as these are successful, they allow adversaries to completely take over the device. Attackers can listen in to calls, read emails—and even access apps such as WhatsApp and Signal, because they can see everything on your iPhone’s screen.
This might sound worrying, but spyware attacks only target a specific subset of users, usually journalists, dissidents, government workers and businesses operating in certain sectors. If this applies to you, Apple has introduced Lockdown Mode to use on your iPhone. It does reduce your iPhone’s functionality, but it’s worth it if you fall into this group and might be at risk.
“These are likely to be highly targeted attacks, on specific people, so ordinary iPhone users don’t have anything to be too concerned about,” says Sean Wright, head of application security at Featurespace.
Even so, he recommends all iPhone users apply security best practices. “Ensure that you apply the latest update, only install apps from trusted sources and apply some scrutiny to those apps—such as reviewing the permissions.”
Other tools such as VPNs “may have some limited benefit,” Wright says. “It will largely depend where the attack is from and how the new spyware works, for example if it scraps the data before network traffic is transmitted and received.”
Signs your iPhone may have been targeted by spyware include slowing of the device, fast draining battery, or overheating. If you do find this happening to your iPhone, in some cases turning it off can disrupt the malware temporarily.
If you have received the alert from Apple, you can contact human rights organization Amnesty International’s Security Lab, which offers digital forensic support to at risk human rights defenders, activists, journalists and members of civil society.
“If you are a member of civil society, and you have received an Apple notification, you can contact us and request forensic support using our Get Help form,” anoticeon Amnesty International’s website reads.
Overall, every iPhone user should be ensuring theiriOS softwareis up to date—the latest version isiOS 17.4.1. Apple might also release a new iOS update to patch the holes used for this latest spyware attack, or the iPhone maker might have even patched it already.

AIMRA accuses Apple India of favouring large retailers. iPhone 15 Pro cashback offers sparks retailer outrage,"As the iPhone 15 series from Apple continues to be one of the best-selling premium smartphones, Apple India is now facing criticism from the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA) over its ""discriminatory"" cashback offers between larger and small retail stores, according to a report by News18.
AIMRA, whichreportedly represents over 1,50,000 mobile phone retailers in India, has accused Apple of engaging in anti-competitive practices with itsiPhone 15 ProandiPhone 15 Pro Maxcashback offers. The association alleges that Apple has allowed its own stores and large retailers to offer cashback of up to₹10,000 on these models, while smaller retail channels are only allowed to offer₹3,000 cashback, as per a Financial Express report.
In a letter to Ashish Chowdhary, the Managing Director of Apple India, Navneet Pathak, the national joint secretary of AIMRA, highlighted the issue. The letter stated that this discrepancy poses a significant risk of loss in sales for the retail channels and raises concerns about unfair competition, further emphasizing that such actions would make customers lose trust in small retailers, the News18 report said.
""This is purely an anti-competitive move favouring few...This discrepancy not only poses a significant risk of loss in sales for the retail channels but also raises concerns of unfair competition. Such actions undermine the trust and confidence we have diligently built with our customers over time,"" the letter read, as quoted by News18.
AIMRA has urged theiPhone makerto resolve the cashback offer quickly in order to ensure that all the retailers are treated equally and to prevent the rise of unhealthy competition in the market. The association has stressed the need for fair competition and trust in the retail ecosystem, the report further added.
The iPhone 15 series was launched in September last year, with the iPhone 15 priced at₹79,900, the iPhone 15 Plus at₹89,900, the iPhone 15 Pro at₹1,34,900, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max at₹1,59,900.

iPhone 16: What to Expect From Apple's Next iPhone,"The iPhone is poised to make its generative AI foray in 2024. Here's what's flying around in the iPhone 16 rumor mill.
As theiPhone 15settles into the market, the tech community is buzzing with anticipation for Apple's next-generation handset, which is expected to be named ""iPhone 16.""
We've heard whispers about the iPhone 16's features, which are said to span from a new power-efficient display to larger screens, better zoom lenses, an action button and, perhaps not surprisingly, a suite of new gen-AI powered features.
Read more:Best iPhone of 2024
However, the iPhone 16 is still presumably six months away and nothing will be confirmed until Apple's iPhone event in the fall. Still, these rumors could give us an idea of what to expect from the next iPhone.
Here are the most credible rumors for the iPhone 16.
Probably not. The newest rumors suggest Apple has been working on iPhone Flip models in two different sizes, though there have been difficulties in making the devices to Apple's standards. The company may also be working on a folding tablet with a screen around the size of an iPad Mini. Even though virtually every major phone-maker -- fromGoogletoOppotoOnePlusandSamsung-- have launched their own bendable handsets, Apple has been characteristically quiet about whether there will ever be an iPhone Flip or an iPhone Fold.
Prior rumors said Apple may not launch its own flexible screen device until 2025. Samsung hasn't let phone fans forget it -- by releasing an app that will let Apple phone owners experience a Z Fold-esque experience byplacing two iPhones side-by-side.
The rumors of larger screen sizes are piling in, at least for select iPhone 16 models. The latest is from Korean publication, the Elec, which published an April report saying selectiPhone 16 models are poised to adopt an innovative screen technology, resulting in thinner bezelsor the frame around the phone's screen. This development could translate to a slightly larger screen area for some iPhone 16 models, although it's not clear which models.
Apple has historically introduced display upgrades in its pro line of products, before sometimes trickling them down to lower-cost models afterwards. The report says display manufacturers have introduced a novel border reduction structure technology, enabling more compact control circuitry and ultimately leading to slimmer bezels.
Speaking of screen sizes, Apple has maintained the two screen sizes for iPhone Pro models since 2020 when it launched the6.1-inch iPhone 12 Proand the6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. However, that's rumored to change with the iPhone 16 Pro models, which might get bigger screens.
Display analyst Ross Young suggested earlier this year that the iPhone 16 Pro models will have larger screens, putting the sizes at 6.3 inches for the iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9 inches for the iPhone 16 Pro Max. That rumor was later corroborated by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who said the iPhone 16 Pro models could grow by ""a couple tenths of an inch diagonally.""
Read More:How the iPhone 16's Design May Change
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models are believed to besticking with the current 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch sizes. If the size increase is accurate, it would be yet another move from Apple to distinguish its Pro iPhone models from its regular ones.
One of the most salient selling points of Samsung's Galaxy S24 series and Google'sPixel 8lineup were each of their souped-up AI tips and tricks, and it wouldn't be a major shock if Apple went in the same direction. Apple CEO Tim Cook has gone on the record this year confirming Apple sees ""a huge opportunity for Apple with gen AI and AI.""
According to Gurman'sPower On newsletter,iOS 18 will feature generative AI technology that ""should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences.""
A Septemberreport from the Informationsays Apple plans to use large language models, a crucial part of generative AI, to make Siri smarter. The report said this feature is expected to be released with an iPhone software update next year.

In March,AppleInsiderpublished a collection of photographs purportedly displaying 3D-printed dummy models of the rumored iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro. The images revealed that the iPhone 16 may have a vertical camera stack as opposed to a diagonal one and an action button, similar the one on last year's iPhone 15 Pro.
Another change that could make its way to iPhone 16 displays is greater power efficiency. Samsung Display is apparently developing a new material set, dubbed M14, specifically for Apple, according to aTheElecreport, which says the new technology should arrive on iPhones launching next year. M14 will replace the blue fluorescent technology that's used now with blue phosphorescence technology, creating an even more power-efficient screen than the current LTPO ones used on Pro models, the report says.
Both the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max could both have 5x telephoto lenses next year. According to Apple analystMing Chi Kuo, a tetraprism lens will make its way to both Pro models next year, as opposed to just the Pro Max model. Apple equipped the iPhone 15 Pro with a 12-megapixel 3x optical zoom, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a 12-megapixel 5x optical zoom camera, which is the equivalent of 120mm lens on a full-frame camera.If this rumor is true, it could mark a breakthrough in design. When Apple launched the 15 Pro Max with its 5x telephoto lens, it cited the phone's bigger body as to why the Pro Max had it, but the Pro didn't.

In a break with the past two years, all four iPhone 16 models will apparently get a next-generation Apple chipset, which will all receive A18 branding. According to aMacRumorsreport citing Jeff Pu, an executive analyst for Haitong International Securities, all four models will have an A18 series chip with Pro iPhone models getting an A18 Bionic Pro and base models getting a regular A18.
The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus currently have an A16 Bionic, which debuted on the 2022 iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, while the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max run on theA17 Pro processor. Pu says the A18 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's cutting-edge 3 nanometer process.

Tim Cook unveiling the iPhone 13 in 2021.
Apple holds its annual iPhone event in September almost every year, so we'd expect the timeline to remain the same for the iPhone 16. New iPhones typically get released shortly thereafter, usually the Friday of the following week. Sometimes Apple will stagger release dates for specific models, especially when introducing a new design or size. So it's possible that the iPhone 16 lineup will have more than one release date.
Apple tends to hold its events on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. The iPhone 15 event was held on Tuesday, Sept. 7. The iPhone 14 event was held on Wednesday, Sept. 7. And the iPhone 13 event was held on Tuesday, Sept. 14.
iPhone release dates are typically a week and a half after Apple's announcements.
In general, new iPhones are released on a Friday, around the third week of September. For the iPhone 13, preorders began Sept. 17 and the phones went on sale Sept. 24."

Apple plans to boost its Indian workforce to 500,000 in 3 years, shifting half of its China-based supply chain, reportedEconomic Times. With a focus on local value addition, Apple aims to increase domestic value addition from 11-12 percent to 15-18 percent. This move aligns with India's growing importance as a market and potential R&D hub. Currently, local value addition in India stands at 14 percent, far below China's 41 percent.
Apple hassignificantly escalated its presence in India over the past two years, focusing on both manufacturing and retail. While older iPhone models were initially assembled in the country, Apple now manufactures iPhone 15 models there as well. Recent strides in streamlining assembly operations have been fruitful, with reports indicating that Apple assembled iPhones worth $14 billion in India in fiscal year 2024.
The Cupertino-based company has two major manufacturing partners, Foxconn and Pegatron, accounting for 67 percent and 17 percent of assembled iPhones respectively. Additionally, Tat Group, managing Wistron’s plant in Karnataka, contributes the remaining 6 percent. This surge in production means approximately 1 in 7 iPhones assembled worldwide is now done in India.

"Google-parent Alphabet fast approaches $2 trillion-mark in m-cap on AI-fueled rally after Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia","Shares of Google's parent company Alphabet is heading back toward what would be a record $2 trillion market value — a milestone surpassed only by Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. in the United States. It has rallied back from last month’s low, when the shares dropped on concerns that the tech leader was falling behind in artificial intelligence (AI), according to a Bloomberg report.
Investors are becoming moreoptimistic about Alphabet Inc.’s AI strategyafter a series of glitches and misfires that sent its shares tumbling. Using this week’s cloud event to show that its AI model is enterprise-ready despite recent stumbles in its consumer-facing tools, investor's focus is now turning to this month’s earnings and a developer’s conference in May.

While Alphabet’s path to AI monetization is still seen as cloudy, the stock’s relatively cheap valuation has kept it attractive to many on Wall Street. “While the headlines haven’t been favorable, Google’s role in generative AI products will present massive growth opportunities for the stock,"" Sylvia Jablonski, chief executive officer at Defiance ETFs told Bloomberg.
Alphabet is also set to benefit from making its own generative AI tools that can power more precise ads and increase revenues from ad spend, she added. Alphabet’s misfiring Gemini product had been viewed as a major setback for a firm known for its technological prowess, with the company pausing an image generation feature that drew criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race.
The company’s cloud computing conference in Las Vegas this week offered investors some reassurance, as the firm showed how Gemini can be used to create advertisements, prevent cybersecurity threats and spin up short videos and podcasts. Google also showed a new chip designed to handle AI workloads.
News that Apple Inc. is considering using Google’s Gemini technology to power AI services added more fuel to the rebound. Up to the last close, Alphabet shares are up 12 per cent this year. The stock trades at 21 times forward earnings, below Microsoft’s 33 times, and about the same as the S&P 500 Index.

“Google’s hardware advances, Gemini progress, and AI driven app demos should help sentiment on AI capabilities,"" Bank of Amercia Corp. analyst Justin Post wrote in a note Tuesday. “We see Cloud as positive driver for stock given AI credibility, faster growth, improving margins.""
Still, not all are convinced by the discount, despite “plenty of people that are making the argument that it’s so cheap right now,"" said Michael Lippert, vice president and portfolio manager at the Baron Opportunity Fund. Given the competitive search space, Alphabet “should be investing every single dollar at a higher ROI (return on investment) into their own businesses,"" he said.
JP Morgan Chase & Co. analyst Doug Anmuth noting this week that he expected Gemini integration to result in more than 20 per cent revenue growth for Google Cloud. According to an earlier report, the move tointroduce a subscription plan for Bard Advanceappears as Google's intention to monetize its advanced AI capabilities and generate additional revenue.
With premium subscriptions, users can anticipate a more sophisticated and feature-rich conversational AI experience, unlocking new possibilities in tasks ranging from understanding and summarizing to coding and planning. As per a report from Android Authority, this strategic shift aligns with Google's broader vision for the future of AI services.

"Kashmir’s apple orchards, millions of jobs, face threat from rail line","Apple farming is Kashmir’s biggest economic driver, employing millions. Now a new railway project threatens many of those livelihoods.
Indian-administered Kashmir –Muhammad Shafi was working in his apple orchard in October last year, in Indian-administered Kashmir, when a group of men rushed in and started measuring his land without asking for his approval.
When he asked the men who they were and what were they doing on his land, Shafi said their response left him stunned. They were government officials sent to mark and measure his orchard for the construction of a railway line.
“They said the land will be used to lay a railway track and a road,” Shafi, 65, told Al Jazeera at his home in the Himalayan region’s Bijbehara area of Anantnag district. “They asked us to refrain from working on our lands.”
Since the officials’ visit, Shafi’s 1,500 sq metre (16,145 sq ft) apple farm has been deserted. Buds have formed on the branches, trees are mulched and it is time to spray them with pesticides.
But Shafi cannot tend to his farm, which is now lined with two 15cm (0.5 ft) concrete poles earmarked by the authorities for the proposed 77km (48-mile) Anantnag-Bijbehara-Pahalgam railway line, one among five such projects totalling about 190km (118 miles) across the picturesque Kashmir valley.
The land to be acquired for the construction is highly fertile for growing apples, the best-known export from the region.
Apple farming is the largest employment generator in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, with nearly 3.5 million farmers – 27 percent of the region’s population – involved in growing the fruit, whose export contributes more than 8 percent to the region’s gross domestic product (GDP).
The apple growers say they have invested their entire lives – and their limited resources – in raising the orchards, only for them to be forcefully taken away by the authorities. Shafi’s orchard effectively belongs to the government now, an acquisition he did not sign up for.
Farmers said they received no formal notice from authorities before officials arrived to review their land — there was only an informal message circulating on WhatApp alerting residents of plans for the rail line.
Many residents said that government survey teams came to measure their orchards accompanied by police and security forces – in effect to prevent any meaningful resistance from farmers.
“We are not even allowed to protest or raise our voice,” said Shafi. “We are helpless.”
Still, many Kashmiri farmers have taken to street protests since the land acquisition began. At one such protest in Shopian, known as the “apple bowl of Kashmir”, Wamiq* from southern Kashmir’s Shopian district said the farmers had little option but to fight for their land. He has a 5,000 sq metre (54,000 sq ft) apple orchard now at risk of government takeover.
“There is already a dearth of job opportunities and now they are depriving us from the only means we have. We don’t have any other skill, we don’t know how to survive without this and no money would compensate [for] the loss,” the 25-year-old said.
“We will anyway die of starvation if they take our land, so it is better to die while fighting for our land,’’ he added.
To be sure, Kashmiris have long sought better connectivity. The Kashmir valley region has one national highway that often gets blocked by landslides and falling rocks during inclement weather in summer and snow during the winter, disconnecting it from the rest of the country, sometimes for days.
Three decades ago, in the mid-1990s, the Indian government began a railway project in several phases, to end that dependence on the highway. This project is expected to be completed by August and will for the first time connect Kashmir to the rest of India through an all-weather rail line.
Last year, the Indian government approved a project to extend this rail initiative further, within Kashmir — including the Anantnag-Bijbehara-Pahalgam that will be built through Shafi’s farm.
The move could help improve transport within Kashmir. But many Kashmiris say the construction of the railway line would mean acquiring nearly 278 hectares (686 acres) of highly fertile lands, most of which are home to apple orchards.
Shamshada Akhtar, a farmer in Anantnag, is among those who may soon lose their orchard. “We spent ample money raising the orchard – the labour costs, fertilisers, pesticides every year for more than 12 years… For what? Only to let authorities take it away on some meagre compensation,” the 43-year-old said.
Officials have not disclosed details of the compensation that would be paid but many growers say they do not want the money.
“One-time compensation is not going to feed us forever. The orchards are not only the source of livelihood for us but for our future generations,” said Akhtar. “This is an emotion for growers like us.”
The fear of losing land – and livelihoods – among residents in Indian-administered Kashmir is compounded by distrust of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, which in 2019 scrapped the region’s special semi-autonomous status and brought it under the direct control of New Delhi.
The government claimed the move would bring peace, speed up investment and create more jobs in the country’s largest Muslim-majority region, which for decades has been the site of a bloody rebellion against Indian rule and in which tens of thousands of people, most of them civilians, have been killed.
But the scrapping of Kashmir’s special status was accompanied by a stringent months-long clampdown which saw the region’s political leaders arrested and basic rights of residents curtailed in order to prevent street protests. Meanwhile, a series of laws were passed by the federal government to further tighten its control over the region, leading to fears of a demographic change and loss of lands and livelihoods.
Shafi said the officials who surveyed his land told him the railway line that would come there would cater primarily to a Hindu pilgrimage to a site in Pahalgam, a famous tourist resort in the Anantnag district.
However, Altaf Thakur, a regional spokesman for the BJP, rejected those suggestions. The railway lines, he said, “will be used by all the people throughout the year and no religious colour should be given to it”.
Then there are ecological concerns as well. Some experts believe the railway lines will reduce forest cover, posing a threat to the local economy and ecology.
Kashmiri environmentalist Raja Muzaffar Bhat told Al Jazeera the authorities should instead “put in efforts to save the land instead of using it for construction purposes”.
“The main railway connection was much-needed but the railway lines through Shopian, Anantnag and other districts require ample trees to be cut, which will put the livelihoods of lakhs [hundreds of thousands] of people in the region at stake,” he said.
Bhat argued the land acquisition is also a violation of a law implemented in 2019 that guaranteed fair compensation, transparency and rehabilitation for those affected by such infrastructure projects. “It’s a democratic law in which you have to consult every stakeholder before acquiring any land,” he said. “Without taking the locals into confidence, putting concrete poles on the land without any notice is unlawful.”
But BJP spokesman Thakur dismissed the charge that laws have been violated. “This step has been taken after taking the environmental factors into consideration and after consulting all stakeholders in the region,” he told Al Jazeera.
When asked about allegations of land grabs by the government to expand the railways, he said: “At this moment, I don’t know what people want but for these railway projects, some land would be needed and some trees will be cut during the process. So we all should wholeheartedly welcome this development in the region.”
Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC, said infrastructure projects “seen as more innocuous” before 2019 are now regarded by the Kashmiris “with more suspicion”.
“Especially given that for many in Kashmir, it’s not a lack of development that concerns the local residents but more so, the level of control of the government in New Delhi,” he said. “For many in Kashmir, it’s a case of New Delhi bringing in more of what is neither needed nor wanted.”
Kugelman said that there is “no reason to believe” that locals would have problems with temporary visitors, such as the pilgrims or the tourists. “The concern is more about the potential for new investors and other residents that plan to come for the long haul – and what that may mean in terms of longer-term social and demographic implications.”
Meanwhile, at Bijbehara, Shafi, a father of four, said he initially worked as a labourer in others’ apple orchards to feed his family until he was able to buy a farm for himself. He said the trees he worked on for nearly a decade have finally started bearing apples, fetching the family about 500,000 rupees (about $6,000) annually.
Now, he rarely visits his orchard. “It distresses me each time I see my orchard, the budding flowers on trees,” he said as tears well up in his eyes.
“It haunts me to even think about how I would be able to provide a livelihood to my children.”
*One farmer’s name has been changed at his request because of fears of retribution from the government.

Apple is reportedly planning a big AI-focused M4 Mac upgrade,"ByEmma Roth,a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.
Apple is getting ready to refresh its entire lineup of Macs with M4 processors that have an emphasis on AI, according to a report fromBloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The new M4-equipped Macs will reportedly start arriving later this year, with the rest coming in early 2025.
Even though Apple just launched itsfirst MacBook Prowith an M3 chip in November 2023, the company is “nearing production” on its M4 chip, sources tellBloomberg. Apple will reportedly emphasize the M4’s AI-processing capabilities once released, which likely comes in response to theslew of rival “AI PCs” hittingthe market and aslowdown in Mac sales.
The M4 chip will come in at least three different tiers, including the entry-level M4 chip codenamed Donan, the mid-tier Brava, and the highest-performing Hidra chip, according toBloomberg. Apple will reportedly add Donan to the entry-level MacBook Pro, its MacBook Airs, and the lower-end Mac Mini. Meanwhile,Bloombergsays Apple will reserve the mid-tier Brava for the higher-specced MacBook Pros, Mac Minis, and the Mac Studio, while adding the top-tier Hidra chip to the Mac Pro.
We will likely get more of a window into the AI features Apple is planning when it holds its annualWorldwide Developers Conference on June 10th.

Apple, Inc. is now calling “state-backed attackers”“mercenary” hackers in email alerts to affected customers, and has changed this language on support documentation on its website as well. This change from the iPhone maker comesmonths after a report of “pressure” from the Indian governmentto give authorities deniability for hacking attempts on political leaders, journalists and activists, who have repeatedly been alerted of unauthorised intrusions into their phones from spyware like Pegasus, which the Intelligence Bureau acquired in 2017.
The change, which now takes direct heat off of any individual nation-states following hacking attempts, coincided with media reports on Thursday morning claiming that a fresh batch of such notifications were sent to users in India and 91 other countries. However, hours after these reports came up, not a single user in any of these countries has publicly reported receiving such an alert. Last November, Apple and the Union government misleadingly claimed that users in 150 countries received such hacking alerts, when in fact only users in India reported receiving them that week.
An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the record on the change in language. Three people who have received such alerts previously in India toldThe Hinduthat they didn’t receive any in the last day. London-based rights group Amnesty International has opened a digital security helpline for individuals who received the alert.
Last December,The Washington Posthad reported that “senior Modi administration officials called Apple’s India representatives to demand that the company help soften the political impact of the warnings,” referring to November’s alerts. At least two individuals who received the alerts that month — the Congress party’s Praveen Chakravarty and news portalThe Wire’s founder editor Siddharth Varadarajan — found in separate forensic examinations that their phones had traces of the Pegasus spyware.

Apple Warns iPhone Users of 'Mercenary Spyware' Attack in 92 Countries,"Photo Credit: Pexels/  @iamhogir
Apple has advised users targeted by mercenary spyware to enable Lockdown Mode on their devices
Applehas warned users in several countries that they might have been the target of a mercenary spyware attack. The alert was issued toiPhoneowners in 92 countries and the company has not attributed these attacks to specific groups and has not revealed a list of countries where users were alerted. Meanwhile, the iPhone maker has also updated its support document with details on how these threat notifications work, along with information for users who might have been targeted by mercenary spyware attacks.
The company has warned users in 92 countries that their iPhone might have been targeted with mercenaryspyware. “Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,” the company says in the email sent out to users on April 10 at 12pm PT (12:30am IST on Thursday) viewed by Gadgets 360.
The email informs users asks users to take the warning seriously, adding that that Apple has ""high confidence"" in the warning — even though it is never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks. Apple's email also states that it has notified users in 150 countries to date, and the company does not attribute these targeted spyware attacks — including those using software likePegasusdeveloped byNSO Group— to specific attackers or geographic regions.
Apple has advised users who received the threat notification email to enable Lockdown Mode on their iPhone — a special mode that reduces the avenues for spyware attacks by disabling several features. Users are also advised toupdate to iOS 17.4.1and keep other devices, messaging, and cloud apps updated. Users targeted by mercenary spyware are also advised by Apple to enlist expert guidance.

The company also updated itssupport documentrelated to threat notifications on Wednesday, explaining how these mercenary spyware attacks work. Once the company detects activity that appears to be consistent with a mercenary attack, it sends an email and iMessage notification to users on their Apple ID-associated email and phone numbers, respectively. Users who sign in to the Apple ID website will also see a Threat Notification banner at the top of the page, according to the support document.
Apple's threat notifications support page also informs users that Apple threat notifications never ask users to click links, open files, install apps, and send their Apple ID password or verification code over the phone or via email, to protect them from fraudulent emails pretending to originate from Apple — the latest threat notification doesn't include clickable links and asks users to type in addresses that are separated by spaces.

Apple Warns Users In 92 Countries They May Have Been Targeted By Mercenary Spyware Attacks,"Apple sent out threat notifications to users in 92 countries on Wednesday, informing them that they may have been the target of “mercenary spyware attacks,” a warning that comes as several countries are preparing to hold critical elections.
iPhone users in 92 countries, including India, received notifications from Apple that their iPhone's... [+]may have been targeted by mercenary spyware attacks.
Appleupdatedthe security notice on its website Wednesday, which states that threat notifications are “designed to inform and assist users who may have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks.”
According to several Indian news outlets, including theEconomic Timesand theIndian Express, some iPhone users in the country received notifications from Apple alerting them of an attack “that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID.”
The notification informed the user they were likely being targeted specifically “because of who you are or what you do,” and urged them to take it “seriously.”
The reports do not name any individuals in India who received the notifications, but it comes just a week before the start of the country’s six-week general elections—the world’s largest democratic exercise.
Apple doesn’t include specific steps for users who have received the notifications, other than urging them to enlist help from cybersecurity experts.
150. That’s the number of countries in which iPhone users have received threat notifications since 2021, the companysaid.
In October, Apple sent out similar notifications to several prominent political leaders in India who represented opposition parties. Rahul Gandhi, the top leader of Congress—India’s main opposition party—told reporters he and several members of his and other opposition parties had received notifications that their iPhones were being targeted by “state-sponsored attackers.” At the time, Gandhi called out Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and accused them of carrying out the attack. Prominent activists and journalists who are critical of the Modi government alsoreceivedthe notification at the time. Appleconfirmedit had sent out the notifications but said it had not attributed it to a “specific state-sponsored attacker.” In late December, Amnesty International said it had conducted a forensic investigation toconfirmApple’s findings and said NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware was used to carry out the attacks. Indian authorities publicly denied carrying out the attacks but, according to theWashington Post, they reportedly pressured Apple to “come up with alternative explanations for the warnings to users,” to ease the political fallout.

Apple Researchers Are Building AI Model Called ‘Ferret UI’ That Can Navigate Through iOS,"Photo Credit: Pexels/Mateusz Taciak
The LLM is designed to automate the perception and interaction within smartphone user interfaces
Appleresearchers have published yet another paper on artificial intelligence (AI) models, and this time the focus is on understanding and navigating through smartphone user interfaces (UI). The yet-to-be peer-reviewed research paper highlights a large language model (LLM) dubbed Ferret UI, which can go beyond traditional computer vision and understand complex smartphone screens. Notably, this is not the first paper on AI published by the research division of the tech giant. It has already published apaperon multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) andanotheron on-device AI models.
The pre-print version of the researchpaperhas been published on arXiv, an open-access online repository of scholarly papers. The paper is titled “Ferret-UI: Grounded Mobile UI Understanding with Multimodal LLMs” and focuses on expanding the use case of MLLMs. It highlights that most language models with multimodal capabilities cannot understand beyond natural images and are functionality “restricted”. It also states the need for AI models to understand complex and dynamic interfaces such as those on a smartphone.
As per the paper, Ferret UI is “designed to execute precise referring and grounding tasks specific to UI screens, while adeptly interpreting and acting upon open-ended language instructions.” In simple terms, the vision language model can not only process a smartphone screen with multiple elements representing different information but it can also tell a user about them when prompted with a query.

Based on an image shared in the paper, the model can understand and classify widgets and recognise icons. It can also answer questions such as “Where is the launch icon”, and “How do I open the Reminders app”. This shows that the AI is not only capable of explaining the screen it sees, but can also navigate to different parts of an iPhone based on a prompt.
To train Ferret UI, the Apple researchers created data of varying complexities themselves. This helped the model in learning basic tasks and understanding single-step processes. “For advanced tasks, we use GPT-4 [40] to generate data, including detailed description, conversation perception, conversation interaction, and function inference. These advanced tasks prepare the model to engage in more nuanced discussions about visual components, formulate action plans with specific goals in mind, and interpret the general purpose of a screen,” the paper explained.
The paper is promising, and if it passes the peer-review stage, Apple might be able to utilise this capability to add powerful tools to theiPhonethat can perform complex UI navigation tasks with simple text or verbal prompts. This capability appears to be ideal for Siri.

"Apple warns users in 91 countries, including India, of Pegasus-like 'mercenary spyware' attacks","NEW DELHI: iPhone maker Apple has issued a series of fresh notifications to users in 91 other countries, including India, cautioning them of 'mercenary spyware' including Pegasus malware that has stirred up significant controversy in recent times.
These new alerts, also received by users in India, are part of cautionary measures warning owners about potential risks to their privacy and data security.
In October 2023, Apple had sent a similar notification to political leaders across various parties in the country, including Congress's Shashi Tharoor, Aam Aadmi Party's Raghav Chadha, and Trinamool Congress' Mahua Moitra. The alert warned of a ""potential state-sponsored spyware attack"" targeting their iPhones.
In 2021, the Supreme Court had formed a committee of technical experts to look into allegations of unauthorised surveillance using the Pegasus software developed by Israeli firm NSO Group.
In August 2022, the Supreme Court-appointed committee concluded that the spyware was not found in the 29 mobile phones examined by it, but malware was found in five mobile phones.
Apple noted that according to public reporting and research by civil society organisations, technology firms and journalists, individually targeted attacks of such exceptional cost and complexity have historically been associated with state actors, including private companies developing mercenary spyware on their behalf, such as Pegasus from the NSO Group.
It said that, though deployed against a very small number of individuals—often journalists, activists, politicians and diplomats—mercenary spyware attacks are ongoing and global.
Since 2021, Apple has said that it has sent out threat notifications multiple times a year as it has detected these attacks, and to date, the company has notified users in over 150 countries in total.
""The extreme cost, sophistication and worldwide nature of mercenary spyware attacks makes them some of the most advanced digital threats in existence today. As a result, Apple does not attribute the attacks or resulting threat notifications to any specific attackers or geographical regions,"" it said.
The phone maker, in its notification, provides additional steps that users can take to help protect their devices, including enabling Lockdown Mode.
Apple advised its users to update their devices with the latest security patches and exercise caution while interacting with suspicious links or messages.

Keeping iPhone Data Hidden From Apple Is ‘Virtually Impossible’,"Apple’s iPhone is known for its privacy credentials. “Privacy. That’s Apple,”readsone of the iPhone maker’s advertising slogans.
It may therefore come as a surprise that privacy researchers have issued a new warning, after finding the iPhone is not as private as it seems. According to researchers at Finland’sAalto University, keeping your iPhone, MacBook and iPad personal data hidden from Apple is “virtually impossible.”
Despite Apple’s privacy focus, your iPhone might not be as private as you think, according to a new... [+]warning from researchers.
While everyone knows about the risks posed by third party apps—and Apple offers itsApp Tracking Transparencyfeatures to counter this—the data collected by the iPhone maker’s own apps is a problem, the Finnish researchers say.
These are Apple’s own apps that come pre-loaded. They are “pretty much unavoidable on a new device, be it a computer, tablet or mobile phone,” the researchers said in astatement.
The researchers studied eight apps available oniPhones, iPads and Macs: Safari, Siri, Family Sharing, iMessage, FaceTime, Location Services, Find My and Touch ID. First, they collected all publicly available privacy-related information on theseapps, including technical documentation and privacy policies and user manuals.
The apps chosen “are an integral part of the platform and ecosystem” that are “glued to the platform”—and “getting rid of them is virtually impossible,” associate professor Janne Lindqvist, head of the computer science department at Aalto said.
The researchers said they were surprised “by the fragility” of Apple’sprivacyprotections. Making things worse, the user interface is designed to be confusing for Apple users, the researchers said.
For example, the user is given the option to enable Siri, but “enabling” only refers to whether you use Siri's voice control. “Siri collects data in the background from other apps you use, regardless of your choice, unless you understand how to go into the settings and specifically change that,” said Lindqvist.
In fact, you can’t easily stop data sharing in any of the iPhone apps studied, according to the researchers. “In practice, protecting privacy on an Apple device requires persistent and expert clicking on each app individually. Apple's help falls short.”
Amel Bourdoucen, a doctoral researcher at Aalto, calls Apple’s online instructions for restricting data access “complex and confusing,” pointing out that the steps required are “scattered in different places.”
While it’s only one study, the findings of the research are certainly a concern andas the researchers ask, what does Apple do with all that data?
While they caveat that it’s impossible to know for sure, Lindqvist suggests the data will be used to “train the artificial intelligence system behind Siri and to provide personalised user experiences, among other things.”
Apple has not confirmed or denied this. I have contacted the iPhone maker for a comment and will update this article if the firm responds.
The privacy versus functionality issue is an age-old problem. Of course you want your iPhone to work effectively and integrate with the rest of the Apple ecosystem. Why else would you only buy Apple devices?
But the researchers think Apple could inform users much more clearly than it does today. They also say you can solve the issue of Apple’s data collection by opting for third party apps that are easy to manage, such as Firefox rather than Safari.
The research does raise interesting points, but it’s important to note firstly that it doesn’t cover Google’s Android at all, which I expect is much worse when compared to Apple.
At the same time, while the researchers found limiting data collection was difficult, Apple has introduced numerous privacy settings and controls that make the iPhone a device worth having.
You can quite easily go through your iPhone Settings and ensure you lock down everything that you can. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security and work your way down the list to restrict permissions for third party and Apple apps—ensuring you aren’t sharing analytics with the iPhone maker. Even doing this is a good start.

Apple Vision Pro brings a new era of spatial computing to business,"Text of this article
April 9, 2024
UPDATE
Apple Vision Pro brings a new era of spatial computing to business
Incredible new enterprise experiences leverage spatial computing to customize workspaces, collaborate on 3D designs, deliver specialized employee training, and guide remote fieldwork in entirely new ways
For decades, Apple has worked to provide innovative products and services for businesses. Today, Apple products are used by all of the Fortune 500 companies in every industry around the world — iPhone and iPad are indispensable for businesses of all sizes, and Mac is preferred by employees when given the choice at work. Apple’s unique combination of hardware, software, services, and built-in support for IT makes it incredibly easy to manage and secure devices at scale. With the introduction ofApple Vision Pro, spatial computing enables enterprises to build experiences that previously were not possible.
“There’s tremendous opportunity for businesses to reimagine what’s possible using Apple Vision Pro at work,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise Marketing. “We’re thrilled to see the innovative ways organizations are already using Apple Vision Pro, from planning fire response operations to iterating on the most intricate details of an engine design — and this is just the beginning. Combined with enterprise-grade capabilities like mobile device management built into visionOS, we believe spatial computing has the potential to revolutionize industries around the world.”
With visionOS built on the foundation of decades of engineering innovation in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, enterprise developers can create powerful spatial experiences controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — a user’s eyes, hands, and voice. The breakthrough design of Apple Vision Pro features an ultra-high-resolution display system and custom Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design to deliver experiences in real time. Vision Pro uses a wide range of advanced machine learning and AI models to enable foundational capabilities such as hand tracking, room mapping, Personas, and more. All of this is accelerated by the Neural Engine in the M2 chip, which ensures spatial computing is the most powerful way for a business to leverage AI.
Developers have been building apps for Apple Vision Pro across numerous enterprise categories, from business productivity and product design, to immersive training and guided work.
Customized Workspaces for Productivity
Spatial computing blends digital content with the physical world, providing an infinite canvas that enables businesses to reinvent workspaces and enhance everyday productivity. With visionOS, apps are freed from the boundaries of a display, so they can appear side by side at any scale. With support for Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, users can set up the perfect workspace and bring the powerful capabilities of their Mac into Apple Vision Pro wirelessly, creating an enormous, private, and portable 4K display with incredibly crisp text. The most-loved productivity apps for business are now available on Vision Pro.
SAP Analytics Cloudhelps streamline the process of gathering, integrating, analyzing, and presenting data-driven insights to enhance business decision-making. On Apple Vision Pro, the app enables employees and executives to immediately access their data dashboard and arrange their most critical business workflows, apps, and cards beautifully in their space. They can also drill down into the data with contextual 3D maps and graphics to gain new insights. With thelatest SDK release for developers, the SAP Business Technology Platform fully supports Apple Vision Pro. Customers and partners can now deploy their SAP apps to Vision Pro, alongside iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.
“Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device, and we are thrilled to leverage the capabilities of spatial computing with SAP Analytics Cloud and SAP Mobile Start,” said Philipp Herzig, chief AI officer, SAP SE. “Going forward, we see the power of visionOS combined with generative AI being a force multiplier for enterprises. SAP Analytics Cloud running on Apple Vision Pro will help our customers discover all-new insights from complex data with powerful and intuitive processes that supercharge their business planning. And with SAP Mobile Start, we provide access to all of SAP’s business applications and workflows in unimaginable ways.”
Microsoft 365productivityapps and AI companion Copilot built for Apple Vision Pro can help users get more done in powerful new ways. Focus mode in Word allows users to write without distraction; graph, manipulate, and visualize data in sharp, crisp detail in Excel; and immerse themselves in a slideshow with PowerPoint. Switching between meetings, chats, and shared content is easy in Teams — along with accessing the assistance of Copilot — with life-size windows that can be arranged in the user’s space.
“Spatial computing has enabled us to rethink how professionals can be productive and work intelligently with the power of AI,” said Nicole Herskowitz, vice president, Microsoft 365 and Teams. “With Microsoft 365 and Teams on Apple Vision Pro, your office moves with you, allowing users to view apps side by side on an infinite canvas with spatial computing for incredible multitasking and collaboration.”
Additional apps in business productivity include:
Design and Collaboration
The display system on Apple Vision Pro packs 23 million pixels across two displays — or more than 4K resolution for each eye — which makes videos, images, and documents crystal clear from any angle. With crisp visualization of 3D content, spatial computing opens up opportunities for product design, retail planning, and construction modeling, and enables new experiences for customers to engage with products and services.
ThePorsche Race Engineerappprovides an entirely new way for the Porsche team to collaborate. Race engineers are constantly making real-time decisions about everything from the performance of the car to the driver’s vitals. Apple Vision Pro helps engineers visualize car data in real time, bringing critical metrics like speed and braking alongside track conditions and car positioning, combined with live video from the car’s dashboard. In February, Porsche broke the U.S. record for electric vehicles at Laguna Seca with the new Porsche Taycan Turbo GT, while the engineers tracked along using Vision Pro. This can also expand track experiences for fans around the world.
“At Porsche, we’ve always been driven by dreams, and Apple Vision Pro has enabled us to reimagine track experiences,” said Oliver Blume, Porsche’s CEO. “The new Porsche Taycan Turbo GT is the ultimate all-electric performance car, and, fittingly, we were thrilled to bring the best of German engineering and Apple’s inspiring product innovation together with the Race Engineer app. This is the perfect example of our team delivering on our goal to bring the best user experience to our employees and customers.”
Design and manufacturing processes are complex and involve large amounts of data from various sources.NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIslet developers stream massive 3D engineering and simulation data sets from the cloud to Apple Vision Pro. The high-resolution displays and powerful sensors built into Vision Pro enable developers and designers to create detailed, immersive renderings and visuals that can be viewed and manipulated in real time.
“The world’s industries are racing to build digital twins of products, facilities, and processes to better test and optimize designs well before constructing them in the physical world,” said Rev Lebaredian, NVIDIA’s vice president of Omniverse and Simulation Technology. “Enterprises can now combine the power and capabilities of Apple Vision Pro and the physically accurate renderings of OpenUSD content with NVIDIA accelerated computing to power the next generation of immersive digital experiences.”
Additional apps in design and collaboration include:
Training and Simulation
From preparing technicians to install equipment, to teaching complex tasks requiring hundreds of hours of hands-on work, making training procedures more interactive and impactful is critical to employee success. When it comes to aircraft maintenance, taking a plane offline for training can be costly and cause delays throughout the system.KLM Royal Dutch Airlineswill dramatically improve technical maintenance and airline operations with spatial computing on Apple Vision Pro. The Engine Shop app enables technicians to train on the latest engine models in full fidelity in their own space. With this app, a technician can instantly see the entire task they need to perform step by step, with detailed repair instructions overlayed on a 3D model of the exact engine. This reduces errors and increases employee job satisfaction while saving valuable time and ultimately speeding up plane turnaround times.
“We see Apple Vision Pro as a tremendous value-add that will improve our fleet availability and operations,” said Bob Tulleken, KLM’s vice president of Operations Decision Support. “Training our employees with spatial computing will lead to fewer costly errors because the most current information they need to do their job is there in front of them as they perform the task. This means we not only get vastly more efficient in our work, but also provide a better work environment for our employees to succeed.”
Additional apps in training and simulation include:
Guided Work
Guided work requires the context of a person’s surroundings, such as a utility service technician who needs access to work orders or schematics.Resolvehas reimagined how building engineers can plan for and access information they need to make decisions about systems behind walls, including HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and fire sprinkler lines. Rather than use static paper plans, users can review high-detail plans and 3D models on Apple Vision Pro, enabling architects, builders, and maintenance workers to see, fix, and comment, enhancing the entire life cycle of a construction project.
In emergency response scenarios, incident management software combines real-time and historical information with geospatial data to help first responders manage their people and fleet resources. TheFireOpsapp, developed by About Objects and DigitalCM, marks a turning point in emergency response management. FireOps leverages the infinite canvas with visionOS to provide a unified operational view of incident action plans, dramatically streamlining over a dozen procedures. This enhances coordination and decision-making among all participants, and ensures that first responders are more connected, informed, and prepared than ever before.
Additional apps in guided work include:
Apple offers developers a variety of resources, including powerful APIs, rich documentation, global developer labs,Develop in Swift tutorials, and the visionOS simulator to help companies bring game-changing Apple Vision Pro experiences to life. To further support developers, today Apple is announcing the Enterprise Spatial Design Lab, providing hands-on support from Apple to help enterprises bring apps from concept to reality. The immersive sessions will be available beginning this summer atdeveloper.apple.com. In addition, Deloitte announced today it is expanding itsApple practiceto include anew Academy for Apple Vision Pro. The practice includes more than 100 practitioners trained to deliver visionOS solutions to clients, with a series of one-week, instructor-led courses to help engineers, product managers, and business leaders prepare for the new era of spatial computing.

Apple Warns Users in 92 Countries About Mercenary Spyware Attacks,"Apple on Wednesday sent threat notifications to users in 92 countries warning that they may have been targeted by mercenary spyware attacks, likely because of who they are or what they do.
According toTechCrunch, Apple sent the alerts to the individuals at 12 p.m. Pacific Time, delivered via email and iMessage using the contact details associated with the user's Apple ID. A notification also appears at the top of the page if the user signs intoappleid.apple.com.
""Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,"" the company wrote in the warning to affected customers. ""We are unable to provide more information about what caused us to send you this notification, as that may help mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future.""
""This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it's never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously,"" added the warning.
In an updatedsupport document, Apple said it has sent similar threat notifications to users in over 150 countries since 2021. ""The extreme cost, sophistication, and worldwide nature of mercenary spyware attacks makes them some of the most advanced digital threats in existence today,"" said the company. ""As a result, Apple does not attribute the attacks or resulting threat notifications to any specific attackers or geographical regions.""
Last October, Apple sent similar warnings to some journalists and politicians in India. Soon after, nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty International reported that it had found Israeli cyber-arms company NSO Group's invasive spyware Pegasus on the iPhones of prominent journalists in India. Users in India are among those who received the latest threat notifications, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke toTechCrunch.
The alerts come at a time when many nations are preparing for democratic elections. Apple previously described the attackers as ""state-sponsored"" in the support document, but has replaced those references with ""mercenary spyware attacks."" The warning to customers reads: ""Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware.""
Apple advises those who have received a threat notification to seek expert help, such as the rapid-response emergency security assistance provided by the Digital Security Helpline at the nonprofit Access Now. Apple threat notification recipients can contact the Digital Security Helpline 24 hours a day, seven days a weekthrough their website.
Users who have not received an Apple threat notification but have good reason to believe they may be individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks are advised toenable Lockdown Modeon their devices for additional protection.

Apple warns of mercenary spyware attacks against iPhone users. Should you be worried?,"Most Popular
Apple is sounding alarm bells over a wave of sophisticated and destructive spyware attacks against specific people across 92 countries. Asreported by The Economic Times, Apple sent an email warning individuals in the crosshairs that they were ""being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone.""
The email explained that the attacks are targeting people specifically because of who they are or what they do. Though the email said that Apple couldn't be absolutely certain when detecting such attacks, the company had high confidence in the warning and urged people to take it seriously.
On Wednesday, Apple also updated its support page onthreat notifications and mercenary spyware. The page explains how mercenary spyware attacks work, how Apple will alert its users if they're the victims of such an attack, and what to do if you're targeted by this kind of attack.
So just what is a mercenary spyware attack, and should the average iPhone user be concerned? On the one hand, most iPhone users will never be targeted by these types of attacks. On the other hand, such an attack could prove devastating for you since the attacker could remotely control and steal sensitive data from your device.
Typically carried out by, or on behalf of, nation states, such attacks are usually launched against individuals with specific roles in society, such as journalists, activists, politicians, and diplomats. The goal is often to strike back at someone because of what they did or said, especially if it runs afoul of a government or political leader or other type of authority.
Also:Removing spyware from your phone can be tricky. These options are your best bet
More advanced and complex than your average cybercrime, a mercenary spyware attack usually targets a small number of people. The attacks can still cost millions of dollars, according to Apple, and are often short lived, creating a challenge for anyone attempting to detect and stop them. Though these attacks are rare, Apple has sent out threat notifications multiple times per year since 2021, notifying people in more than 150 countries.
""It's really important to recognize that mercenary spyware, unlike others, is deliberately designed with advanced capabilities, including zero-day exploits, complex obfuscation techniques, and self-destruct mechanisms, making it highly effective and hard to detect,"" Krishna Vishnubhotla, VP of Product Strategy at mobile security provider Zimperium, told ZDNET. ""Operating in stealth is key to its success. The developers of mercenary spyware go to great lengths to remove any clues that might link the software back to them or their clients.""
Probably the best known spyware for these types of attacks is Israel-based NSO Group's Pegasus, which has been used in mercenary spyware campaigns against notedjournalists,politicians, and other individuals. The NSO Group typically skirts any responsibility, claiming that the firm sells Pegasus only to intelligence and law enforcement agencies and that Pegasus can only be used against terrorists and criminals.
Apple and other companies have neverthelesssued the NSO Groupfor its role in state-sponsored attacks. Apple has also been forced tocreate and deploy bug fixesfor the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch to shore up vulnerabilities exploited by Pegasus.
Although such attacks are often state-sponsored, Appleremoved that term from its alert and from the latest update to its support page, after facing pressure from the  Indian government about linking such breaches to state actors, a  source with direct knowledge told Reuters. The support page does, however, still state that ""individually targeted attacks of such exceptional cost and complexity have historically been associated with state actors.""
How would you know if you're being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack? If Apple determines that you're a potential victim, you'll receive an email and a text message with an alert. A threat notification will also appear at the top ofyour Apple ID pageafter you sign in.
Apple also suggests that all iPhone users take these steps to protect themselves from spyware and similar threats:
You can also protect yourself against such attacks by turning onLockdown Mode, which disables or limits key features and settings to prevent the spyware from stealing sensitive data. In the event of an attack, Apple recommends that you also reach out to experts, such as the rapid-response emergency security assistance offered by theDigital Security Helpline at the nonprofit group Access Now."
iPhone 17 Pro Models to Arrive in 2025 With 2nm Chipset Built by TSMC: Report,"Photo Credit: Apple
Apple's 2nm chips may debut on models that arrive two years after the iPhone 15 Pro (pictured)
Apple is planning to launch the firstiPhoneequipped with a processor built on a 2nm process in 2025, according to a report. The Cupertino company will reportedly launch the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max with a next generation chipset from TSMC. TheiPhone 15 Promodels were the first phones from Apple to be equipped with a 3nm A17 Pro chip, while the standard iPhone models still run on the 4nm A16 Bionic chipset that previously powered the Pro models launched in 2022.
According to a DigiTimesreport(viaApple Insider) citing supply chain sources, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) is preparing a new chip manufactured on its 2nm process for the iPhone 17 Pro models that are expected to launch in the second half of 2024.Appleis also expected to introduce Mac models with 2nm chips in the future, but the report does not specify a timeline for these processors.
With TSMC on track to produce the 2nm chips that will be built on its ""N2"" process technology, theiPhone 17 ProandiPhone 17 Pro Maxare likely to be the first smartphones to feature the next generation chips, while the standard iPhone 17 models could be equipped with a previous generation chipset, a process Apple has followed since theiPhone 14, which featured the same chip as theiPhone 13 Pro.
While the Taiwanese chip firm will start production of 2nm chip designs next year, it is also working on a more advanced version of the ""N2"" process technology for even better 2nm chips that will be ready by 2026-end, according to the report. This suggests that the first iPhone models with chips built on the ""N2P"" process technology could be from theiPhone 19series that could debut a year later in 2027.
TSMC is also working on its more advanced ""A14"" process technology, which will allow it to produce 1.4nm chipsets, according to the report. However, there's currently no word on a timeline for production of chips on the advanced process technology, which means it could be years before an iPhone model is launched with a 1.4nm processor.

Apple aiming to release first M4-powered Macs this year with a focus on AI,"Apple is planning a major overhaul to its Mac lineup with the advent of the M4 family of chips. According to a new reportfrom Bloomberg, Apple is planning a “new family of in-house processors designed to highlight artificial intelligence.”
The report says that Apple is “nearing production” of the first M4 chips. “The new chip will come in at least three main varieties, and Apple is looking to update every Mac model with it,” Mark Gurman writes.
The transition to the M4 will start later this year and include a new iMac, a lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, and a refreshed Mac mini.
Apple is aiming to release the updated computers beginning late this year and extending into early next year. There will be new iMacs, a low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, and Mac minis — all with M4 chips. But the company’s plans could change.
Apple is then planning to follow up with more M4 Macs throughout 2025. That includes updates to the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air by the spring, the Mac Studio around the middle of the year, and the Mac Pro later in 2025.
The M4 family will include an entry-level variant as well as at least two higher-performance versions. With the M4 chips, Apple reportedly plans to “highlight the AI processing capabilities of the components and how they’ll integrate with the next version of macOS.”
The entry-level M4 chip, code-named Donan, will power the entry-level MacBook Pro as well as the MacBook Air and entry-level Mac mini. The first higher-end chip, code-named Brava, will appear in the Mac Studio, higher-spec MacBook Pro models, and a higher-end Mac mini.
The report also includes some good news for Mac Pro fans:
The highest-end Apple desktop, the Mac Pro, is set to get the new Hidra chip. The Mac Pro remains the lower-selling model in the company’s computer lineup, but it has a vocal fan base. After some customers complained about the specifications of Apple’s in-house chips, the company is looking to beef up that machine next year.
For the highest-end desktop Mac configurations, Apple is considering support for up to half a terabyte of RAM. That’s up from the current max of 192GB.
As it stands right now, Apple still hasn’t released an M3-powered version of the Mac Studio or the Mac Pro. Gurman’s report today at least leaves the door open for the possibility of an M3 Mac Studio with a “still-unreleased M3-era chip.”
As a refresher, the Mac Studio is available with the M2 Max and M2 Ultra configurations. While the M3 Max is currently available in the MacBook Pro, Apple hasn’t yet unveiled the M3 equivalent of the M2 Ultra.

Apple Confirms Major iPhone Changes With New App Features Enabled,"Apple has just changed the guidelines in the App Store to respond to something called an anti-steering mandate from the European Commission. Here’s what’s changed.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro.
April 11 update below. This post was first published on April 8, 2024.
When the European Union fined Apple $2 billion for anti-competitive conduct against other music services in March, it was because Apple refused to allow music streaming apps to feature links to websites where they could sign up outside the app. This was known as anti-steering.
It meant that Spotify, for example, couldn’t advertise that it was possible for users to sign up to its service on Spotify’s own website—something that Spotify, found appealing since it circumvented the requirement to pay commission to Apple that would have been charged had the sign-up happened within the app (though signing up on the App Store was a feature Spotify removed some time ago).
In the last few days, Applehas updated its App Store guidelineson the Apple’s website for developers to change how apps work—for now these changes and others introduced in the recent Digital Markets Act, only apply in the EU, but you can be sure that governments around the world are watching carefully to see if they want to match the new rules.
It’s noticeable that on the new guidelines, the second paragraph of the introduction is about the EU, a sign of how transformative the changes there are proving to be.
The guidelines now refer to this change: “Music streaming apps in specific regions can use Music Streaming Services Entitlements to include a link (which may take the form of a buy button) to the developer’s website that informs users of other ways to purchase digital music content or services.”
It’s not quite the same as signing up in the app, which would entail the commission Apple charges. Instead, “These entitlements also permit music streaming app developers to invite users to provide their email address for the express purpose of sending them a link to the developer’s website to purchase digital music content or services.”
There’s another change, as pointed out by9to5Mac, and it applies worldwide. As the report notes, “For the first time, Apple is allowing developers to create and distribute game emulators on the App Store. The news was confirmed by Apple in an email sent to developers.”
This is a very big change. Game developers have long been trying to bring game emulators to iOS users. The report continues, “The App Store guidelines have never allowed emulator software, but some apps have had luck bypassing Apple’s review process by disguising their apps and hiding emulators within them. But that’s changing now with the App Store’s new guidelines.” App developers are responsible for the software in an emulator app, “including ensuring that such software complies with these Guidelines and all applicable laws,” Apple says.
April 11 update. The rumblings from the Digital Markets Act, the EU legislation that has sought to open up the iPhone and other brands’ products in the EU, and is directly related to the new mandates in the App Store, are continuing. As well as Apple updating its App Store guidelines, there’s now a new report which indicates how another element of the Act is going in terms of user responses.
This is the requirement for Apple to offer EU users a list of web browsers during setup, rather than defaulting to Safari, for instance. It turns out, in a new report fromReuters, highlighted by9to5Mac, that the new arrangement has meant that more people are choosing browsers that are not Safari when asked.
It’s long been possible to choose another browser. For instance, if you download Chrome, and go to Chrome settings in the Settings app, you can manually choose Chrome as the default browser.
But what’s new is that at setup, Apple has to show a screen inviting you to choose your default browser and, so as to keep a level playing field, the list of browsers must be presented at random.
And the report says “Independent browser companies in the European Union are seeing a spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Apple to make it easier for users to switch to rivals, according to data provided to Reuters by six companies.”
One such browser is Aloha, which is based in Cyprus. It says users jumped 250% in March, and added, ""Before, EU was our number four market, right now it's number two,"" according to the company’s CEO.
Similarly, Vivaldi, Ecosia and Brave have all reported rises in user numbers since the new regulation came into force. Many of these rises will have been on the iPhone.

Apple now makes 1 in 7 iPhones in India as output hits $14 billion,"Listen to Story
Apple has significantly increased its iPhone production in India, assembling a whopping $14 billion worth of iPhones in fiscal 2024, reported Bloomberg News.
The report indicates that Apple now manufactures approximately 14% of its flagship devices in India, which translates to about 1 in 7 iPhones, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Foxconn and Pegatron, two major Taiwanese manufacturers, have played significant roles in boosting Apple's production output in India. Foxconn assembled nearly 67% of the India-made iPhones, while Pegatron Corp contributed about 17%, reported Bloomberg.
The remaining portion of the India-made iPhones was produced at Wistron Corp's plant in Karnataka which was taken over by the Tata Group last year.
Apple has not commented on the Bloomberg report.
Apple's move to ramp up iPhone production in India comes as the tech giant seeks to diversify its supply chain beyond China amidst escalating geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington.
Although China remains the largest hub for iPhone manufacturing globally, Apple is strategically expanding its manufacturing footprint to reduce reliance on a single location.
In a recent development reported by news agency Reuters,Pegatron is reportedly in advanced discussionsto transfer control of its only iPhone manufacturing facility, located near Chennai in Tamil Nadu, to the Tata Group.
Additionally, the Tata Group is constructing another plant in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, where Pegatron is expected to become its joint venture partner.Published By:Koustav DasPublished On:Apr 10, 2024Must Watch"

It has been a few years since Apple started assembling iPhones in India. However, in the last couple of years, the Cupertino-based tech giant has taken huge strides in streamlining assembly operations in India and is yielding results. According to a report by Bloomberg, in fiscal year 2024, Apple has assembled iPhones worth $14 billion in India.
Apple has two major manufacturing partners in India — Foxconn and Pegatron. As per the report, Foxconn constituted close to 67% of the assembled iPhones whereas Pegatron assembled 17% of the iPhones. Tat Group, which took over Wistron’s plant in Karnataka, made the remaining 6% of iPhones. The report says that about 1 in 7 iPhones assembled in the world are now being done in India.
Apple’s big India push
In the last two years, Apple has been upping the ante in India — both in manufacturing and retail. Till the last few years, it was the older generation of iPhone models which were assembled in India. However, currently Apple assembles the iPhone 15 models as well in India.
In terms of manufacturing, reports have suggested that Apple is looking to diversity out of China and has been looking at other markets. India is expected to be a key player in Apple’s future manufacturing plans. However, China will remain integral to the company’s plans as made clear by Apple CEO Tim Cook on a recent visit to the country.
Apple has also opened its first retail stores in India. The two stores — Apple BKC and Apple Saket — were inaugurated by Cook in Mumbai and New Delhi respectively in April 2023. Rumour has it that Apple in the next few years will open a couple of more retail outlets.
Apple has emerged as the top player in the country’s premium smartphone market, as per Counterpoint Research in November 2023. Apple’s market share still remains low as India remains a predominantly Android market but it has started to make inroads.

The iPhone notification you definitely don't want to get,"






There's one alert that you really don't want to get on your iPhone.
The warning that your phone may have been targeted in a spyware attack is sure to send a chill down your spine — especially if it's likely because of who you are.
That's the warning that some iPhone users in 92 countries received on Wednesday, TechCrunchreported. Apple has sent out similar notifications in the past.
""Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID,"" the notification read, according to TechCrunch.
""This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it's never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously.""
Related stories
Apple does not share what exactly prompts threat notifications or how those threats are detected, according to itssupport page, as that ""may help mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future.""
Since the warnings were sent simultaneously, it's not exactly clear when the possible targeting of various users occurred. Apple notes that it sends threat notifications ""multiple times a year.""
The tech giant says that, since 2021, it has notified users in over 150 countries of potential spyware attacks. The most common targets are journalists, activists, politicians, diplomats, and other figures of influence.
If you do get Apple's spyware notification, there aren't many options that are recommended. But Apple ""strongly suggests"" that users contact third-party experts, such as the nonprofitDigital Security Helpline.
""Outside organisations do not have any information about what caused Apple to send a threat notification, but they can assist targeted users with tailored security advice,"" says Apple.
Last year, several independent Russian media outlets made headlines after Apple warned they werebeing targeted by a ""state-sponsored"" spyware attack— reportedly, a Russian government program with the ability to hack iPhones by utilizing NSO Group's ""zero click"" Pegasus spyware, which can be sent over iMessage.
Apple seems to have dropped the ""state-sponsored"" warning in this latest wave of notifications, though the company notes that ""individually targeted attacks of such exceptional cost and complexity have historically been associated with state actors, including private companies developing mercenary spyware on their behalf.""
Apple did not immediately return a request for comment before publication.

"iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus Tipped to Arrive in Seven Colour Options, Two More than iPhone 15 Lineup","Photo Credit: Apple
iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus were launched in five colour options last year
Apple's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to debut later this year with a few design changes, such as a new vertically aligned camera layout and the Action button that arrived last year on theiPhone 15 Pro. A tipster now claims that Apple will introduce its next iPhone models in two additional colour options this year. An earlier report suggested that the iPhone 16 Pro models will swap two existing colourways on the iPhone 15 Pro models with new ones.
According to apostby tipster Fixed Focus Digital (translated from Chinese) on Weibo, the upcoming iPhone 16 Plus (as well as the regular iPhone 16) will be available in Black, Blue, Green, Pink, Purple, White, and Yellow colourways. The Purple and White options are new additions, while the others will be the same from the standardiPhone 15models.
While five of the seven rumoured colour options are the same as the iPhone 15 models, Apple could still launch its upcoming handsets different shades. The current generation iPhone 15 andiPhone 15 Pluscolour options are more muted with a matte finish on the rear panel — especially the Blue variant — compared to their predecessors, while this year's models might be more vibrant.
Earlier this year, it wasreportedthat the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be launched in new grey and gold finishes. These two are expected to replace two existing ones from the iPhone 15 Pro lineup — Apple only introduces its Pro models in four colourways every year. This year's iPhone 16 Pro models could arrive in new Desert Titanium and Titanium Grey colourways.
The upcoming iPhone 16 series is likely to debut in the second half of 2024, based on Apple's previous release timelines. Before these phones are unveiled, Apple is also expected to show off new software features coming to users as part of iOS 18, macOS 15, and other software updates at its upcoming WWDC 2024 event that begins on June 10.

Apple opens access to used iPhone components for repair,"On Thursday, Appleannounced that it has opened its iPhone repair process to include used components. Starting this fall, customers and independent repair shops will be able to fix the handset using compatible components.
Components that don’t require configuration (such as volume buttons) were already capable of being harvested from used devices. Today’s news adds all components — including the battery, display and camera — which Apple requires to be configured for full functionality. Face ID will not be available when the feature first rolls out, but it is coming down the road.
At launch, the feature will be available solely for the iPhone 15 line on both the supply and receiving ends of the repair. That caveat is due, in part, to limited interoperability between the models. In many cases, parts from older phones simply won’t fit.  The broader limitation that prohibited the use of components from used models comes down to a process commonly known as “parts paring.”
Apple has defended the process, stating that using genuine components is an important aspect of maintaining user security and privacy. Historically, the company hasn’t used the term “parts pairing” to refer to its configuration process, but it acknowledges that phrase has been widely adopted externally. It’s also aware that the term is loaded in many circles.
“‘Parts pairing’ is used a lot outside and has this negative connotation,” Apple senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, tells TechCrunch. “I think it’s led people to believe that we somehow block third-party parts from working, which we don’t. The way we look at it is, we need to know what part is in the device, for a few reasons. One, we need to authenticate that it’s a real Apple biometric device and that it hasn’t been spoofed or something like that. … Calibration is the other one.”
Right-to-repair advocates have accused Apple of hiding behind parts pairing as an excuse to stifle user-repairability. In January, iFixit called the process the “biggest threat to repair.” The post paints a scenario wherein an iPhone user attempts to harvest a battery from a friend’s old device, only to be greeted with a pop-up notification stating, “Important Battery Message. Unable to verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple battery.”
It’s a real scenario and surely one that’s proven confusing for more than a few people. After all, a battery that was taken directly from another iPhone is clearly the real deal.
Today’s news is a step toward resolving the issue on newer iPhones, allowing the system to effectively verify that the battery being used is, in fact, genuine.
“Parts pairing, regardless of what you call it, is not evil,” says Ternus. “We’re basically saying, if we know what module’s in there, we can make sure that when you put our module in a new phone, you’re gonna get the best quality you can. Why’s that a bad thing?”
The practice took on added national notoriety when it was specifically targeted by Oregon’s recently passed right-to-repair bill. Apple, which has penned an open letter in support of a similar California bill, heavily criticized the bill’s parts pairing clause.
“Apple supports a consumer’s right to repair, and we’ve been vocal in our support for both state and federal legislation,” a spokesperson for the company noted in March. “We support the latest repair laws in California and New York because they increase consumer access to repair while keeping in place critical consumer protections. However, we’re concerned a small portion of the language in Oregon Senate Bill 1596 could seriously impact the critical and industry-leading privacy, safety and security protections that iPhone users around the world rely on every day.”
While aspects of today’s news will be viewed as a step in the right direction among some repair advocates, it seems unlikely that it will make the iPhone wholly compliant with the Oregon bill. Apple declined to offer further speculation on the matter.
Biometrics — including fingerprint and facial scans — continue to be a sticking point for the company.
“You think about Touch ID and Face ID and the criticality of their security because of how much of our information is on our phones,” says Ternus. “Our entire life is on our phones. We have no way of validating the performance of any third-party biometrics. That’s an area where we don’t enable the use of third-party modules for the key security functions. But in all other aspects, we do.”
It doesn’t seem coincidental that today’s news is being announced within weeks of the Oregon bill’s passage — particularly given that these changes are set to roll out in the fall. The move also appears to echo Apple’s decision to focus more on user-repairability with the iPhone 14, news that arrived amid a rising international call for right-to-repair laws.
Apple notes, however, that the processes behind this work were set in motion some time ago. Today’s announcement around device harvesting, for instance, has been in the works for two years.
For his part, Ternus suggests that his team has been focused on increasing user access to repairs independent of looming state and international legislation. “We want to make things more repairable, so we’re doing that work anyway,” he says. “To some extent, with my team, we block out the news of the world, because we know what we’re doing is right, and we focus on that.”
Overall, the executive preaches a kind of right tool for the right job philosophy to product design and self-repair.
“Repairability in isolation is not always the best answer,” Ternus says. “One of the things that I worry about is that people get very focused as if repairability is the goal. The reality is repairability is a means to an end. The goal is to build products that last, and if you focus too much on [making every part repairable], you end up creating some unintended consequences that are worse for the consumer and worse for the planet.”
Also announced this morning is an enhancement to Activation Lock, which is designed to deter thieves from harvesting stolen phones for parts. “If a device under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled,” the company notes, “calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted.”
Ternus adds that, in addition to harvesting used iPhones for parts, Apple “fundamentally support[s] the right for people to use third-party parts as well.” Part of that, however, is enabling transparency.
“We have hundreds of millions of iPhones in use that are second- or third-hand devices,” he explains. “They’re a great way for people to get into the iPhone experience at a lower price point. We think it’s important for them to have the transparency of: was a repair done on this device? What part was used? That sort of thing.”
When iOS 15.2 arrived in November 2021, it introduced a new feature called “iPhone parts and service history.” If your phone is new and has never been repaired, you simply won’t see it. If one of those two qualifications does apply to your device, however, the company surfaces a list of switched parts and repairs in Settings.
Ternus cites a recentUL Solutions studyas evidence that third-party battery modules, in particular, can present a hazard to users.
“We don’t block the use of third-party batteries,” he says. “But we think it’s important to be able to notify the customer that this is or isn’t an authentic Apple battery, and hopefully that will motivate some of these third parties to improve the quality.”
While the fall update will open harvesting up to a good number of components, Apple has no plans to sell refurbished parts for user repairs."
Apple Watch Series 10 to feature LTPO OLED screen for enhanced efficiency and battery life: Report,"Apple is gearing up for the launch of its latest wearable, the Apple Watch Series 10, later this year. A recent report from South Korean publication The Elec suggests that the tech giant is making significant advancements in the display technology of the upcoming smartwatch, promising improved battery life for users.
According to The Elec, theApple Watch Series10 will feature a new type of OLED screen called low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO), coupled with thin-film transistor (TFT) technology. This upgrade in display technology is anticipated to enhance the efficiency of the device, ensuring longer battery life compared to its predecessor, the Apple Watch Series 9.
The report indicates that Apple is shifting away from the use of low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) technology in most of its switching transistors for the Series 10. Instead, LTPS technology will only be utilized for circuits outside thePixel areaand a few remaining switching TFTs. This strategic change is expected to contribute to the improved battery performance of the upcoming smartwatch.
Recent developments suggest that Apple has decided against pursuing in-house development ofmicroLEDscreens, as reported by Bloomberg. This decision led to reorganization within the display engineering teams and layoffs within the company. Despite this shift in display technology, the Apple Watch Series 10 is still anticipated to offer notable advancements in its display capabilities when it hits the market in the latter half of 2024.
The launch of theApple Watch Series 10is expected to coincide with the unveiling of the iPhone 16 series. This lineup is speculated to comprise four models: the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. As anticipation builds for these upcoming releases, consumers eagerly await the innovative features and enhancements that Apple will bring to its latest offerings in wearable technology and smartphones.

Apple Responds to Criticism Over iPhone's 'Parts Pairing' Process,"Apple today announced that customers and independent repair shops will be able torepair select iPhones with used genuine Apple partsstarting later this year. Alongside the announcement, Apple's hardware engineering chief John Ternusspoke withTechCrunchabout the iPhone's controversial ""parts pairing"" process.
Repair website iFixitcriticized Apple's parts pairing processlast year, and Oregon recentlypassed a lawthat would ban Apple from using a ""parts pairing"" process in the state for devices manufactured after January 1, 2025.
Ternus argued that iPhones still work with most third-party parts:
""'Parts pairing' is used a lot outside and has this negative connotation,"" Apple senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, tells TechCrunch. ""I think it's led people to believe that we somehow block third-party parts from working, which we don't. The way we look at it is, we need to know what part is in the device, for a few reasons. One, we need to authenticate that it's a real Apple biometric device and that it hasn't been spoofed or something like that. … Calibration is the other one.""
One exception is third-party parts related to Face ID and Touch ID, which do not work in iPhones for security reasons, according to Ternus:
""You think about Touch ID and Face ID and the criticality of their security because of how much of our information is on our phones,"" says Ternus. ""Our entire life is on our phones. We have no way of validating the performance of any third-party biometrics. That's an area where we don't enable the use of third-party modules for the key security functions. But in all other aspects, we do.""
Apple does alert customers if an iPhone part is not genuine. If an iPhone has been repaired, a ""Parts and Service History"" section appears in the Settings app under General → About, and it shows if non-genuine Apple parts have been installed.
Ternus said this transparency surrounding repairs is important:
""We have hundreds of millions of iPhones in use that are second- or third-hand devices,"" he explains. ""They're a great way for people to get into the iPhone experience at a lower price point. We think it's important for them to have the transparency of: was a repair done on this device? What part was used? That sort of thing.""
Apple says it will be expanding the ""Parts and Service History"" section to show whether a used part is a genuine Apple part later this year. For more details about used parts being allowed for repairs, readour earlier coverage.

Apple hit with ‘mercenary spyware attacks’ — iPhone users warned worldwide of ‘most advanced digital threats’,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.
A terrifying and extremely advanced cyberattack hasimpacted iPhone usersfrom at least 92 countries, including India,Reuters reported.
Parent company Apple warned targeted users in an email that hackers aimed to “remotely compromise the iPhone” andupdated its guidanceabout these cases of highly sophisticated device infiltration Wednesday.
Called “mercenary attacks,” they actually don’t hone in on average users to lift a bank account number or other personal information. Everyday people typically are never a target at all even.
Instead, they commonly target high-profile individuals — “likely because of who they are or what they do” — in small numbers.
They typically include politicians, diplomats, journalists and activists, according to Apple.
“The extreme cost, sophistication and worldwide nature of mercenary spyware attacks makes them some of the most advanced digital threats in existence today,” Apple wrote in its new guidance.
“Such attacks are vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware, as mercenary spyware attackers apply exceptional resources to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices.”
“Mercenary spyware attacks are exceptionally well funded and they evolve over time.”
While the latest warning removes the term “state-sponsored” — Reuters reported that Apple came under fire last fall over an incident with the Indian government and its opposition leaders — the tech giant still notes these attacks “have historically been associated with state actors.”
Other times, a proxy can be used on a nation’s behalf.
Since 2021, users in at least 150 nations have been warned by Apple that their devices might have been impacted by the “exceptionally well funded” attacks that have been improving and evolving over time.
If affected, a “Threat Notification” will appear online at the top of an Apple webpage after users sign in with their Apple ID throughappleid.apple.com.
Apple will then send both an email and iMessage ping to the user’s phone and associated email address.

Apple 14-Inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro Is a Whopping $550 Off Today Only,"Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Apple's previous-gen MacBook Pro is still extremely capable, and this configuration has tons of storage to boot.
The14-inch MacBook Prois agreat laptopthanks to its surprisingly thin and light build while still boasting a whole lot of power. If portability really is your key requirement, theMacBook Airis the way to go. But if you need performance as well as portability, you can't beat the 14-inch MacBook Pro. Apple's MacBook Pro lineup has never been a cheap one, which makes this deal all the more impressive. Right now B&H Photo will sell you the M2 Pro-equipped MacBook Pro with an upgraded1TB SSD for just $1,949which is $550 off its original list price and just$50 more than Best Buyis selling the base 512GB model for right now.
While it's true that the M2 Pro isn't the latest chip in Apple's silicon lineup, it's still a great option. The M2 Pro chip inside this laptop sports an upgraded 19-core GPU and 12-core CPU married to 16GB of RAM. Storage is taken care of with a superfast 1TB SSD to round out the core specs.
Compared to theM3 MacBook Pro, the older chip actually has more GPU cores which could be important depending on what you're using it for and the newer chip actually hasslowermemory performance, too. There are areas where the M3 Pro comes up trumps, including hardware-accelerated ray tracing and dynamic caching, but for the majority of people, the M2 Pro is likely to be just the ticket. Especially when you can save some cash, too. (A similarly specced M3 Pro model would cost$2,399 at Apple.)
Other notable features include a large 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display as well as support forWi-Fi 6Eand Bluetooth 5.3. You'll of course get a great keyboard with a Touch ID sensor for payments and authentication, while the huge Force Touch trackpad handles cursor control. And all in a gorgeous metal body that's available in two different colors.

Apple iPad Pro 2024 Release Date: Latest News On When It Will Launch,"When Apple releases its next iPads, it will mark the end of the longest period without updates to Apple’s tablet line in history. It looks like it’ll be early May. Here’s your latest timetable.
Apple iPad Pro (2022 update). The next Pro could be just weeks away.
April 10 update below. This post was first published on April 7, 2024.
Previously, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman had explicitly said that the next Apple iPad release would be “around the end of March or in April,” though that didn’t come to pass. According to his latestPower On newsletter, however, “You can circle early May in your calendar.”
Now, I am far too much of a gentleman to point out thatthat’s exactly what I’ve been saying all along, andmost recently predictedan onsale date of Friday, May 10 or the following Friday, May 17. How does that stack up now?
Well, Gurman says, “For those looking for more specific timing, I’m told the launch will probably happen the week of May 6. Another data point to that end: Apple retail stores are preparing to receive new product marketing materials later that week. That’s typically a sign that a new product release is incoming.”
That seems to me to line up exactly with my last guess. I would say the order of business is this: announcement on Monday, May 6 or Tuesday, May 7 as many countries around the world have May Day as a public holiday on the Monday.
Then, pre-orders would begin on Friday, May 10. Initial reviews would appear a few days later, with the onsale date of Friday, May 17.
I think we can count on a new iPad Pro, in two sizes, 12.9-inch and 11-inch or thereabouts, with OLED as the screen technology for the first time. A newly redesigned Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil thatmay just have been accidentally leaked.Oh, and there’s a small sting in the tail: OLED may force up the price of the iPad Pro models, though it’s not yet clear by how much.
But Gurman goes further, adding that two new iPad Air models will also be unveiled, that is, a larger-screened model (12.9 inches or so) alongside a new version of the current 10.9-inch model.
If that’s right, he’s right to say, “Altogether, this launch is shaping up to be one of the biggest updates to the Apple tablet in a single day.”
It’s one thing for a pundit to be wrong about a release date, but a release dateandwhat’s being announced is pushing it.
So, although I find it baffling that Apple would dilute the effect of the iPad Pro with a new iPad Air, it’s not inconceivable—after all, it happily launches four new iPhones each fall, right?
We’ll know soon enough.
April 9 update. More details are emerging about Apple’s iPad plans. First of all, Mark Gurman has said that while he believes the iPad Pro and iPad Air will both be updated with models announced in early May, that it’s a longer wait for the entry-level iPad and iPad mini.
Gurman said, “The company is also working on new versions of the low-end iPad and iPad mini, but those won’t be coming before the end of the year at the earliest. The new downscale iPad will probably end up being a cost-reduced version of the 10th generation model from 2022, while the iPad mini update won’t include much more than a processor upgrade.”
Gurman is clear, then, that while they could both come this year, by caveating his comments with “at the earliest”, that 2025 is also an option. Which would mean that the iPad Pro launch next month, plus iPad Air if that arrives, too, would be the only update in 2024.
I’d find this surprising (though, mind you, I was pretty astonished there was no iPad launched at all in 2023 nor yet in 2024) but it lends credence to the idea that the iPad Air could be on its way in May as well. I still find this less likely than the iPad Pro on its own, but I’m open to being persuaded.
April 10 update. A new report fromDigiTimeshas just appeared and says that Apple is not holding a spring event this year. I have to say that’s no surprise to me, and if there were an event that would be much more newsworthy.
The report points out that the recent MacBook Air models with M3 chips were launched by press release and that Apple is likely to propose the same process for its new iPad unveiling. I think that might be true, though I wouldn’t rule out something similar to what happened with the reveal for the M3 chips, MacBook Pro and iMac in October, when Apple released a recorded keynote online. I believe that may be what happens in early May. It combines the sense of an important moment, though without the in-person element which takes extra time to arrange. Or maybe there will be a screening event as there was for the Halloween Mac event?
But the report goes on with a predicted new release date—and it’s not good news for the impatient among us. The report says, “Regarding the new iPad series… it is speculated that since Apple's WWDC event is scheduled from June 11th to 15th, 2024, the new iPad products could be announced during said event and hit the market in late June.”
Please note, if your first reaction was that WWDC actually starts on June 10, remember that this site is based in Asia and the 10 a.m. Pacific keynote actually starts at 2 a.m. on Tuesday, June 11 in that region thanks to the time difference.
So, how likely is this? Not very, I’d say. While there have been hardware releases announced at WWDC in the past, the buzz around this year’s event is so much about software and AI, that I think there just won’t be time for anything else.
My best guess remains the same, that the unveil date for the iPad Pro, and Air if it’s there, will be as above, Monday, May 6 or Tuesday, May 7, with onsale dates from Friday, May 17.

Apple will relax repair policy to allow used genuine parts with select iPhones,"Here’s an early Earth Day victory for the planet we all inhabit. Apple is relaxing the rules for its repair policies to allow used genuine parts for the first time. The change will apply to select iPhones and go into effect this fall.
Apple’s SVP of Hardware Engineering and maybe-future-CEO-who-knows John Ternus emphasized the environmental impact of the policy change:
“At Apple, we’re always looking for new ways to deliver the best possible experience for our customers while reducing the impact we have on the planet, and a key part of that means designing products that last,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering.
“For the last two years, teams across Apple have been innovating on product design and manufacturing to support repairs with used Apple parts that won’t compromise users’ safety, security, or privacy. With this latest expansion to our repair program, we’re excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.”
Apple explains that the repair policy change extends to biometric sensors as well:
Apple teams have been hard at work over the last two years to enable the reuse of parts such as biometric sensors used for Face ID or Touch ID, and beginning this fall, calibration for genuine Apple parts, new or used, will happen on device after the part is installed. In addition, future iPhone releases will have support for used biometric sensors.
Also making news, Apple is changing its requirement for a device serial number when ordering parts:
And in order to simplify the repair process, customers and service providers will no longer need to provide a device’s serial number when ordering parts from the Self Service Repair Store for repairs not involving replacement of the logic board.
Finally, there’s an Activation Lock element to the change to ensure stolen phones aren’t sold off for parts:
Apple will also extend its popular Activation Lock feature to iPhone parts in order to deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts. Requested by customers and law enforcement officials, the feature was designed to limit iPhone theft by blocking a lost or stolen iPhone from being reactivated. If a device under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled, calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted.

Apple's AirPods Pro 2 Drop to $189 at Amazon With New Models Looming,"Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
With updated AirPods on the horizon for the latter half of 2024, Amazon has shaved $60 off these premium earbuds packed with top-notch features.
Apple's AirPods Pro come packed with a bevy of great features including impressive audio, instant device pairing and excellent noise cancelation. But these earbuds carry a hefty cost, which is why it's best to get these popular models when you find a deal. Amazon has slashed the cost of the latest second-gen AirPods Pro earbuds with a USB-C charging case to just $189 right now -- but this offer could end at any time, so you'll want to be quick to lock in this price.
Apple'sAirPods Pro earbudshave earned quite a reputation as a stellar option for Apple fans, but at their usual $249 asking price they're not the most affordable option for all users. If you've been holding out on upgrading to the latest and greatest model out there, now's the time. Right now they're availableat a $60 discountif you buy at Amazon, dropping the cost down to just $189. That's just $9 above the lowest price we've seen, making this a deal well worth jumping on before it's gone.
Even witha refreshed AirPods lineup potentially on the horizon, Apple's second-gen AirPods Pro are still among thebest noise-canceling earbudsyou're likely to find. They also sport Apple's transparency mode for when you need to be more aware of your surroundings, and they can automatically optimize their volume based on your environment. In use, the earbuds promise an impressive battery life of up to 30 hours on a single charge (including the battery life stored in the charging case). They also instantly pair and switch between Apple devices, making these wireless earbuds a joy to use for those in the Apple ecosystem.
If you plan on buying these to use with yourApple Vision Proheadset, you'll enjoy support for 20-bit/48 kHz lossless audio with ultralow latency. The Apple Vision Pro has its own built-in speakers so AirPods aren't an essential add-on, but they do allow for a more immersive -- and private -- viewing experience if you want to lose yourself in a movie.
Not into Apple's buds or looking for headphones instead? There are tons ofheadphone and earbud dealsavailable right now.

"Apple to Allow Used Parts for Repairs, Starting With iPhone 15 Lineup","Apple todayannouncedthat customers and independent repair shops will be able to utilize used genuine Apple parts in repairs starting later this year.
AppletoldThe Washington Postthat the new policy will initially apply to parts for iPhone 15 models and newer, including screens, batteries, and cameras. Apple's press release said the policy will eventually extend to used biometric sensors for Face ID and Touch ID.

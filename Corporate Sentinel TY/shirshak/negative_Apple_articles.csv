AIMRA accuses Apple India of favouring large retailers. iPhone 15 Pro cashback offers sparks retailer outrage,"As the iPhone 15 series from Apple continues to be one of the best-selling premium smartphones, Apple India is now facing criticism from the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA) over its ""discriminatory"" cashback offers between larger and small retail stores, according to a report by News18.
AIMRA, whichreportedly represents over 1,50,000 mobile phone retailers in India, has accused Apple of engaging in anti-competitive practices with itsiPhone 15 ProandiPhone 15 Pro Maxcashback offers. The association alleges that Apple has allowed its own stores and large retailers to offer cashback of up to‚Çπ10,000 on these models, while smaller retail channels are only allowed to offer‚Çπ3,000 cashback, as per a Financial Express report.
In a letter to Ashish Chowdhary, the Managing Director of Apple India, Navneet Pathak, the national joint secretary of AIMRA, highlighted the issue. The letter stated that this discrepancy poses a significant risk of loss in sales for the retail channels and raises concerns about unfair competition, further emphasizing that such actions would make customers lose trust in small retailers, the News18 report said.
""This is purely an anti-competitive move favouring few...This discrepancy not only poses a significant risk of loss in sales for the retail channels but also raises concerns of unfair competition. Such actions undermine the trust and confidence we have diligently built with our customers over time,"" the letter read, as quoted by News18.
AIMRA has urged theiPhone makerto resolve the cashback offer quickly in order to ensure that all the retailers are treated equally and to prevent the rise of unhealthy competition in the market. The association has stressed the need for fair competition and trust in the retail ecosystem, the report further added.
The iPhone 15 series was launched in September last year, with the iPhone 15 priced at‚Çπ79,900, the iPhone 15 Plus at‚Çπ89,900, the iPhone 15 Pro at‚Çπ1,34,900, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max at‚Çπ1,59,900.

Apple Researchers Are Building AI Model Called ‚ÄòFerret UI‚Äô That Can Navigate Through iOS,"Photo Credit: Pexels/Mateusz Taciak
The LLM is designed to automate the perception and interaction within smartphone user interfaces
Appleresearchers have published yet another paper on artificial intelligence (AI) models, and this time the focus is on understanding and navigating through smartphone user interfaces (UI). The yet-to-be peer-reviewed research paper highlights a large language model (LLM) dubbed Ferret UI, which can go beyond traditional computer vision and understand complex smartphone screens. Notably, this is not the first paper on AI published by the research division of the tech giant. It has already published apaperon multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) andanotheron on-device AI models.
The pre-print version of the researchpaperhas been published on arXiv, an open-access online repository of scholarly papers. The paper is titled ‚ÄúFerret-UI: Grounded Mobile UI Understanding with Multimodal LLMs‚Äù and focuses on expanding the use case of MLLMs. It highlights that most language models with multimodal capabilities cannot understand beyond natural images and are functionality ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù. It also states the need for AI models to understand complex and dynamic interfaces such as those on a smartphone.
As per the paper, Ferret UI is ‚Äúdesigned to execute precise referring and grounding tasks specific to UI screens, while adeptly interpreting and acting upon open-ended language instructions.‚Äù In simple terms, the vision language model can not only process a smartphone screen with multiple elements representing different information but it can also tell a user about them when prompted with a query.

Based on an image shared in the paper, the model can understand and classify widgets and recognise icons. It can also answer questions such as ‚ÄúWhere is the launch icon‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHow do I open the Reminders app‚Äù. This shows that the AI is not only capable of explaining the screen it sees, but can also navigate to different parts of an iPhone based on a prompt.
To train Ferret UI, the Apple researchers created data of varying complexities themselves. This helped the model in learning basic tasks and understanding single-step processes. ‚ÄúFor advanced tasks, we use GPT-4 [40] to generate data, including detailed description, conversation perception, conversation interaction, and function inference. These advanced tasks prepare the model to engage in more nuanced discussions about visual components, formulate action plans with specific goals in mind, and interpret the general purpose of a screen,‚Äù the paper explained.
The paper is promising, and if it passes the peer-review stage, Apple might be able to utilise this capability to add powerful tools to theiPhonethat can perform complex UI navigation tasks with simple text or verbal prompts. This capability appears to be ideal for Siri.

It has been a few years since Apple started assembling iPhones in India. However, in the last couple of years, the Cupertino-based tech giant has taken huge strides in streamlining assembly operations in India and is yielding results. According to a report by Bloomberg, in fiscal year 2024, Apple has assembled iPhones worth $14 billion in India.
Apple has two major manufacturing partners in India ‚Äî Foxconn and Pegatron. As per the report, Foxconn constituted close to 67% of the assembled iPhones whereas Pegatron assembled 17% of the iPhones. Tat Group, which took over Wistron‚Äôs plant in Karnataka, made the remaining 6% of iPhones. The report says that about 1 in 7 iPhones assembled in the world are now being done in India.
Apple‚Äôs big India push
In the last two years, Apple has been upping the ante in India ‚Äî both in manufacturing and retail. Till the last few years, it was the older generation of iPhone models which were assembled in India. However, currently Apple assembles the iPhone 15 models as well in India.
In terms of manufacturing, reports have suggested that Apple is looking to diversity out of China and has been looking at other markets. India is expected to be a key player in Apple‚Äôs future manufacturing plans. However, China will remain integral to the company‚Äôs plans as made clear by Apple CEO Tim Cook on a recent visit to the country.
Apple has also opened its first retail stores in India. The two stores ‚Äî Apple BKC and Apple Saket ‚Äî were inaugurated by Cook in Mumbai and New Delhi respectively in April 2023. Rumour has it that Apple in the next few years will open a couple of more retail outlets.
Apple has emerged as the top player in the country‚Äôs premium smartphone market, as per Counterpoint Research in November 2023. Apple‚Äôs market share still remains low as India remains a predominantly Android market but it has started to make inroads.

"Apple to Allow Used Parts for Repairs, Starting With iPhone 15 Lineup","Apple todayannouncedthat customers and independent repair shops will be able to utilize used genuine Apple parts in repairs starting later this year.
AppletoldThe Washington Postthat the new policy will initially apply to parts for iPhone 15 models and newer, including screens, batteries, and cameras. Apple's press release said the policy will eventually extend to used biometric sensors for Face ID and Touch ID. Apple's existing parts ""pairing"" process will confirm whether or not a used part is genuine.
In the fall, Apple says calibration for both new and used genuine Apple parts will happen on device after the part is installed. If an iPhone has been repaired, a ""Parts and Service History"" section appears in the Settings app under General ‚Üí About, and Apple says it will be expanding this section to show whether a genuine part is new or used.
Apple also announced that customers and service providers will no longer need to provide a device's serial number when ordering parts from itsself-service repair storefor repairs not involving replacement of the logic board.
To deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts, Apple said it will be extending its Activation Lock security feature to iPhone parts:
Apple will also extend its popular Activation Lock feature to iPhone parts in order to deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts. Requested by customers and law enforcement officials, the feature was designed to limit iPhone theft by blocking a lost or stolen iPhone from being reactivated. If a device under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled, calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted.
Apple's hardware engineering chief John Ternus said the new policy will be more environmentally friendly by extending the lifespan of parts:
For the last two years, teams across Apple have been innovating on product design and manufacturing to support repairs with used Apple parts that won't compromise users' safety, security, or privacy. With this latest expansion to our repair program, we're excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.
Apple said the policy will apply to future iPhone models.

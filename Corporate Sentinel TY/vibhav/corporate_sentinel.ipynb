They crawl the web and create a map of thelink relationshipsbetween sites. The tools also prioritize what they crawl because the web is huge, so not everything gets crawled, much less included in their index.\\nThis is what was asked:\\n\\u201cI have a couple backlinks on google search console on the \\u201cexternal links\\u201d page and I know recently I have gotten a few more.\\nHowever, on Ahrefs it says I have none. Is there a reason? My website is relatively new but I feel like that should not matter because everything is indexed and working properly. Is there a reason?\\u201d\\nCounting Links Is Subjective\\nMueller said that there\\u2019s no \\u201cobjective\\u201d way to count links, which may be a reference to the fact that everytoolhas to make a choice of what they crawl and include in their index.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no objective way to count links on the web, and every tool collects its own data from crawling, which every tool does differently, so there will always be differences.\\u201d\\nMueller\\u2019s answer first addressed not focusing on link counts and that search engines are able to discover webpages in ways other than links.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cMy recommendation would be not to focus so much on the absolute count of links. There are many ways that search engines can discover websites, such as with sitemaps.\\u201d\\nIn the last part of his answer begins talking about links and appears to downplay them.\\nMueller commented:\\n\\u201cThere are more important things for websites nowadays, and over-focusing on links will often result in you wasting your time doing things that don\\u2019t make your website better overall.\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty clear that he\\u2019s not talking about backlink counts anymore. He\\u2019s talking about links.\\nRelated:Link Building for SEO: A Complete Guide\\nOver the past six months Google has been saying and hinting thatlinks are less importantthan they used to be.

Published by Alpha Brand Media.\",\n          \"Suit claimed tech giant tracked activity of people who thought they were privately using its Chrome browser\\u2019s incognito mode\\nGoogle agreed to destroy billions of records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who thought they were browsing privately in itsChromebrowser\\u2019s incognito mode.\\nUsers alleged that Google\\u2019s analytics, cookies and apps let theAlphabetunit improperly track people who set Google\\u2019s Chrome browser to \\u201cincognito\\u201d mode and other browsers to \\u201cprivate\\u201d browsing mode.\\nThey said this turnedGoogleinto an \\u201cunaccountable trove of information\\u201d by letting it learn about their friends, favorite foods, hobbies, shopping habits and the \\u201cmost intimate and potentially embarrassing things\\u201d they hunt for online.\\nTerms of the settlement were filed on Monday in the Oakland, California, federal court, and require approval by US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. The class action began in 2020, covering millions of Google users who used private browsing since 1 June 2016.\\nUnder the settlement, Google will update disclosures about what it collects in \\u201cprivate\\u201d browsing, a process it has already begun. It will also let incognito users block third-party cookies for five years.\\n\\u201cThe result is that Google will collect less data from users\\u2019 private browsing sessions, and that Google will make less money from the data,\\u201d the plaintiffs\\u2019 lawyers wrote.\\nLawyers for the plaintiffs valued the accord at more than $5bn, and as high as $7.8bn. Though users will not receive damages, they may still sue individually for damages. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nAccording to court papers, Google supports final approval of the settlement but disagrees with the plaintiffs\\u2019 \\u201clegal and factual characterizations\\u201d.\\n\\u201cWe are limited in how strongly we can market Incognito because it\\u2019s not truly private, thus requiring really fuzzy, hedging language that is almost more damaging,\\u201d Google\\u2019s chief marketing officer, Lorraine Twohill, wrote to the CEO, Sundar Pichai, in 2019.\\nDavid Boies, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a statement called the settlement \\u201ca historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies\\u201d.\\nA preliminary settlement had been reached in December, advertising a scheduled 5 February 2024 trial. Terms were not disclosed at the time. The plaintiffs\\u2019 lawyers plan to later seek unspecified legal fees payable by Google.\\nThe company has faced similar suits before. In 2022, the Texas attorney general sued the company, alleging that \\u201cincognito mode or \\u2018private browsing\\u2019 is a web browser function that implies to consumers that Google will not track your search history or location activity\\u201d.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They crawl the web and create a map of thelink relationshipsbetween sites. The tools also prioritize what they crawl because the web is huge, so not everything gets crawled, much less included in their index.\\nThis is what was asked:\\n\\u201cI have a couple backlinks on google search console on the \\u201cexternal links\\u201d page and I know recently I have gotten a few more.\\nHowever, on Ahrefs it says I have none. Is there a reason? My website is relatively new but I feel like that should not matter because everything is indexed and working properly. Is there a reason?\\u201d\\nCounting Links Is Subjective\\nMueller said that there\\u2019s no \\u201cobjective\\u201d way to count links, which may be a reference to the fact that everytoolhas to make a choice of what they crawl and include in their index.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no objective way to count links on the web, and every tool collects its own data from crawling, which every tool does differently, so there will always be differences.\\u201d\\nMueller\\u2019s answer first addressed not focusing on link counts and that search engines are able to discover webpages in ways other than links.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cMy recommendation would be not to focus so much on the absolute count of links. There are many ways that search engines can discover websites, such as with sitemaps.\\u201d\\nIn the last part of his answer begins talking about links and appears to downplay them.\\nMueller commented:\\n\\u201cThere are more important things for websites nowadays, and over-focusing on links will often result in you wasting your time doing things that don\\u2019t make your website better overall.\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty clear that he\\u2019s not talking about backlink counts anymore. He\\u2019s talking about links.\\nRelated:Link Building for SEO: A Complete Guide\\nOver the past six months Google has been saying and hinting thatlinks are less importantthan they used to be. Google\\u2019s update coincided with four changes to their documentation that downplayed the role of links, including the removing the word \\u201cimportant\\u201d in a sentence about links as a ranking factor.

Published by Alpha Brand Media.\",\n          \"Suit claimed tech giant tracked activity of people who thought they were privately using its Chrome browser\\u2019s incognito mode\\nGoogle agreed to destroy billions of records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who thought they were browsing privately in itsChromebrowser\\u2019s incognito mode.\\nUsers alleged that Google\\u2019s analytics, cookies and apps let theAlphabetunit improperly track people who set Google\\u2019s Chrome browser to \\u201cincognito\\u201d mode and other browsers to \\u201cprivate\\u201d browsing mode.\\nThey said this turnedGoogleinto an \\u201cunaccountable trove of information\\u201d by letting it learn about their friends, favorite foods, hobbies, shopping habits and the \\u201cmost intimate and potentially embarrassing things\\u201d they hunt for online.\\nTerms of the settlement were filed on Monday in the Oakland, California, federal court, and require approval by US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. The class action began in 2020, covering millions of Google users who used private browsing since 1 June 2016.\\nUnder the settlement, Google will update disclosures about what it collects in \\u201cprivate\\u201d browsing, a process it has already begun. It will also let incognito users block third-party cookies for five years.\\n\\u201cThe result is that Google will collect less data from users\\u2019 private browsing sessions, and that Google will make less money from the data,\\u201d the plaintiffs\\u2019 lawyers wrote.\\nLawyers for the plaintiffs valued the accord at more than $5bn, and as high as $7.8bn. Though users will not receive damages, they may still sue individually for damages. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nAccording to court papers, Google supports final approval of the settlement but disagrees with the plaintiffs\\u2019 \\u201clegal and factual characterizations\\u201d.\\n\\u201cWe are limited in how strongly we can market Incognito because it\\u2019s not truly private, thus requiring really fuzzy, hedging language that is almost more damaging,\\u201d Google\\u2019s chief marketing officer, Lorraine Twohill, wrote to the CEO, Sundar Pichai, in 2019.\\nDavid Boies, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a statement called the settlement \\u201ca historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies\\u201d.\\nA preliminary settlement had been reached in December, advertising a scheduled 5 February 2024 trial. Terms were not disclosed at the time. The plaintiffs\\u2019 lawyers plan to later seek unspecified legal fees payable by Google.\\nThe company has faced similar suits before. In 2022, the Texas attorney general sued the company, alleging that \\u201cincognito mode or \\u2018private browsing\\u2019 is a web browser function that implies to consumers that Google will not track your search history or location activity\\u201d.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They crawl the web and create a map of thelink relationshipsbetween sites. The tools also prioritize what they crawl because the web is huge, so not everything gets crawled, much less included in their index.\\nThis is what was asked:\\n\\u201cI have a couple backlinks on google search console on the \\u201cexternal links\\u201d page and I know recently I have gotten a few more.\\nHowever, on Ahrefs it says I have none. Is there a reason? My website is relatively new but I feel like that should not matter because everything is indexed and working properly. Is there a reason?\\u201d\\nCounting Links Is Subjective\\nMueller said that there\\u2019s no \\u201cobjective\\u201d way to count links, which may be a reference to the fact that everytoolhas to make a choice of what they crawl and include in their index.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no objective way to count links on the web, and every tool collects its own data from crawling, which every tool does differently, so there will always be differences.\\u201d\\nMueller\\u2019s answer first addressed not focusing on link counts and that search engines are able to discover webpages in ways other than links.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cMy recommendation would be not to focus so much on the absolute count of links. There are many ways that search engines can discover websites, such as with sitemaps.\\u201d\\nIn the last part of his answer begins talking about links and appears to downplay them.\\nMueller commented:\\n\\u201cThere are more important things for websites nowadays, and over-focusing on links will often result in you wasting your time doing things that don\\u2019t make your website better overall.\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty clear that he\\u2019s not talking about backlink counts anymore. He\\u2019s talking about links.\\nRelated:Link Building for SEO: A Complete Guide\\nOver the past six months Google has been saying and hinting thatlinks are less importantthan they used to be.

Published by Alpha Brand Media.\",\n          \"Suit claimed tech giant tracked activity of people who thought they were privately using its Chrome browser\\u2019s incognito mode\\nGoogle agreed to destroy billions of records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who thought they were browsing privately in itsChromebrowser\\u2019s incognito mode.\\nUsers alleged that Google\\u2019s analytics, cookies and apps let theAlphabetunit improperly track people who set Google\\u2019s Chrome browser to \\u201cincognito\\u201d mode and other browsers to \\u201cprivate\\u201d browsing mode.\\nThey said this turnedGoogleinto an \\u201cunaccountable trove of information\\u201d by letting it learn about their friends, favorite foods, hobbies, shopping habits and the \\u201cmost intimate and potentially embarrassing things\\u201d they hunt for online.\\nTerms of the settlement were filed on Monday in the Oakland, California, federal court, and require approval by US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. The class action began in 2020, covering millions of Google users who used private browsing since 1 June 2016.\\nUnder the settlement, Google will update disclosures about what it collects in \\u201cprivate\\u201d browsing, a process it has already begun. It will also let incognito users block third-party cookies for five years.\\n\\u201cThe result is that Google will collect less data from users\\u2019 private browsing sessions, and that Google will make less money from the data,\\u201d the plaintiffs\\u2019 lawyers wrote.\\nLawyers for the plaintiffs valued the accord at more than $5bn, and as high as $7.8bn. Though users will not receive damages, they may still sue individually for damages.

They crawl the web and create a map of thelink relationshipsbetween sites. The tools also prioritize what they crawl because the web is huge, so not everything gets crawled, much less included in their index.\\nThis is what was asked:\\n\\u201cI have a couple backlinks on google search console on the \\u201cexternal links\\u201d page and I know recently I have gotten a few more.\\nHowever, on Ahrefs it says I have none. Is there a reason? My website is relatively new but I feel like that should not matter because everything is indexed and working properly. Is there a reason?\\u201d\\nCounting Links Is Subjective\\nMueller said that there\\u2019s no \\u201cobjective\\u201d way to count links, which may be a reference to the fact that everytoolhas to make a choice of what they crawl and include in their index.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no objective way to count links on the web, and every tool collects its own data from crawling, which every tool does differently, so there will always be differences.\\u201d\\nMueller\\u2019s answer first addressed not focusing on link counts and that search engines are able to discover webpages in ways other than links.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cMy recommendation would be not to focus so much on the absolute count of links. There are many ways that search engines can discover websites, such as with sitemaps.\\u201d\\nIn the last part of his answer begins talking about links and appears to downplay them.\\nMueller commented:\\n\\u201cThere are more important things for websites nowadays, and over-focusing on links will often result in you wasting your time doing things that don\\u2019t make your website better overall.\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty clear that he\\u2019s not talking about backlink counts anymore. He\\u2019s talking about links.\\nRelated:Link Building for SEO: A Complete Guide\\nOver the past six months Google has been saying and hinting thatlinks are less importantthan they used to be. Google\\u2019s update coincided with four changes to their documentation that downplayed the role of links, including the removing the word \\u201cimportant\\u201d in a sentence about links as a ranking factor. Everything else in the sentence remained the same, they only removed the word \\u201cimportant\\u201d from the documentation.\\nBefore:\\n\\u201cGoogle uses links as an important factor in determining the relevancy of web pages.\\u201d\\nAfter:\\nGoogle uses links as a factor in determining the relevancy of web pages.\\nRead about March 2024 changes to links:Google March 2024 Core Update: 4 Changes To Link Signal\\nThe first express statement that a Googler made was at PubCon Austin last fall where Gary Illyes stated that links aren\\u2019t even in the top 3 of ranking factors.\\nJohn Mueller even gave a hint two years ago thatthe role of links was going to become less important.\\nHe said:\\n\\u201c\\u2026it\\u2019s something where I imagine, over time, the weight on the links at some point will drop off a little bit as we can figure out a little bit better how the content fits in within the context of the whole web.\\u201d\\nRead the Reddit discussion:\\nWhy are my backlinks not showing up?\\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Asier Romero\\nI have 25 years hands-on experience in SEO and have kept on\\u00a0 top of the evolution of search every step ...\\nConquer your day with daily search marketing news.\\nJoin Our Newsletter.\\nGet your daily dose of search know-how.\\nIn a world ruled by algorithms, SEJ brings timely, relevant information for SEOs, marketers, and entrepreneurs to optimize and grow their businesses -- and careers.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024Search Engine Journal.All rights reserved. Published by Alpha Brand Media.\",\n          \"Suit claimed tech giant tracked activity of people who thought they were privately using its Chrome browser\\u2019s incognito mode\\nGoogle agreed to destroy billions of records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who thought they were browsing privately in itsChromebrowser\\u2019s incognito mode.\\nUsers alleged that Google\\u2019s analytics, cookies and apps let theAlphabetunit improperly track people who set Google\\u2019s Chrome browser to \\u201cincognito\\u201d mode and other browsers to \\u201cprivate\\u201d browsing mode.\\nThey said this turnedGoogleinto an \\u201cunaccountable trove of information\\u201d by letting it learn about their friends, favorite foods, hobbies, shopping habits and the \\u201cmost intimate and potentially embarrassing things\\u201d they hunt for online.\\nTerms of the settlement were filed on Monday in the Oakland, California, federal court, and require approval by US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. The class action began in 2020, covering millions of Google users who used private browsing since 1 June 2016.\\nUnder the settlement, Google will update disclosures about what it collects in \\u201cprivate\\u201d browsing, a process it has already begun. It will also let incognito users block third-party cookies for five years.\\n\\u201cThe result is that Google will collect less data from users\\u2019 private browsing sessions, and that Google will make less money from the data,\\u201d the plaintiffs\\u2019 lawyers wrote.\\nLawyers for the plaintiffs valued the accord at more than $5bn, and as high as $7.8bn. Though users will not receive damages, they may still sue individually for damages. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nAccording to court papers, Google supports final approval of the settlement but disagrees with the plaintiffs\\u2019 \\u201clegal and factual characterizations\\u201d.\\n\\u201cWe are limited in how strongly we can market Incognito because it\\u2019s not truly private, thus requiring really fuzzy, hedging language that is almost more damaging,\\u201d Google\\u2019s chief marketing officer, Lorraine Twohill, wrote to the CEO, Sundar Pichai, in 2019.\\nDavid Boies, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a statement called the settlement \\u201ca historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies\\u201d.\\nA preliminary settlement had been reached in December, advertising a scheduled 5 February 2024 trial. Terms were not disclosed at the time. The plaintiffs\\u2019 lawyers plan to later seek unspecified legal fees payable by Google.\\nThe company has faced similar suits before. In 2022, the Texas attorney general sued the company, alleging that \\u201cincognito mode or \\u2018private browsing\\u2019 is a web browser function that implies to consumers that Google will not track your search history or location activity\\u201d.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They crawl the web and create a map of thelink relationshipsbetween sites. The tools also prioritize what they crawl because the web is huge, so not everything gets crawled, much less included in their index.\\nThis is what was asked:\\n\\u201cI have a couple backlinks on google search console on the \\u201cexternal links\\u201d page and I know recently I have gotten a few more.\\nHowever, on Ahrefs it says I have none. Is there a reason? My website is relatively new but I feel like that should not matter because everything is indexed and working properly. Is there a reason?\\u201d\\nCounting Links Is Subjective\\nMueller said that there\\u2019s no \\u201cobjective\\u201d way to count links, which may be a reference to the fact that everytoolhas to make a choice of what they crawl and include in their index.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no objective way to count links on the web, and every tool collects its own data from crawling, which every tool does differently, so there will always be differences.\\u201d\\nMueller\\u2019s answer first addressed not focusing on link counts and that search engines are able to discover webpages in ways other than links.\\nHe answered:\\n\\u201cMy recommendation would be not to focus so much on the absolute count of links. There are many ways that search engines can discover websites, such as with sitemaps.\\u201d\\nIn the last part of his answer begins talking about links and appears to downplay them.\\nMueller commented:\\n\\u201cThere are more important things for websites nowadays, and over-focusing on links will often result in you wasting your time doing things that don\\u2019t make your website better overall.\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty clear that he\\u2019s not talking about backlink counts anymore. He\\u2019s talking about links.\\nRelated:Link Building for SEO: A Complete Guide\\nOver the past six months Google has been saying and hinting thatlinks are less importantthan they used to be. Google\\u2019s update coincided with four changes to their documentation that downplayed the role of links, including the removing the word \\u201cimportant\\u201d in a sentence about links as a ranking factor.

The class action began in 2020, covering millions of Google users who used private browsing since 1 June 2016.\\nUnder the settlement, Google will update disclosures about what it collects in \\u201cprivate\\u201d browsing, a process it has already begun. It will also let incognito users block third-party cookies for five years.\\n\\u201cThe result is that Google will collect less data from users\\u2019 private browsing sessions, and that Google will make less money from the data,\\u201d the plaintiffs\\u2019 lawyers wrote.\\nLawyers for the plaintiffs valued the accord at more than $5bn, and as high as $7.8bn. Though users will not receive damages, they may still sue individually for damages. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nAccording to court papers, Google supports final approval of the settlement but disagrees with the plaintiffs\\u2019 \\u201clegal and factual characterizations\\u201d.\\n\\u201cWe are limited in how strongly we can market Incognito because it\\u2019s not truly private, thus requiring really fuzzy, hedging language that is almost more damaging,\\u201d Google\\u2019s chief marketing officer, Lorraine Twohill, wrote to the CEO, Sundar Pichai, in 2019.\\nDavid Boies, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a statement called the settlement \\u201ca historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies\\u201d.\\nA preliminary settlement had been reached in December, advertising a scheduled 5 February 2024 trial. Terms were not disclosed at the time. The plaintiffs\\u2019 lawyers plan to later seek unspecified legal fees payable by Google.\\nThe company has faced similar suits before. In 2022, the Texas attorney general sued the company, alleging that \\u201cincognito mode or \\u2018private browsing\\u2019 is a web browser function that implies to consumers that Google will not track your search history or location activity\\u201d.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It hit a high of Rs 1285.35 and low of Rs 1242.15 during the session. \\n\\n On the technical charts, the 200-DMA of the stock stood at Rs 1180.29, while the 50-DMA was at Rs 1239.5. If a stock trades above 50-DMA and 200-DMA, it usually means the immediate trend is upward. On the other hand, if the stock trades below 50-DMA and 200-DMA, it is considered a bearish trend and if trades between these averages, then it suggests the stock can go either way. \\n\\n The stock traded below the signal line of momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalling a bearish bias on the counter. The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect \\\"buy\\\" or \\\"sell\\\" opportunities. \\n\\n On the other hand, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the stock stands at 46.22. Traditionally, a stock is considered overbought when the RSI value is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30. \\n\\n The return on equity (RoE) for the stock stood at 10.51 per cent while the Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) was at 9.56.

The brokerage believe that the stock has factored in pessimism and market failed to single out the companies like HNDL whose earnings are relatively less susceptible to commodity prices and ~60% of EBITDA comes from conversion business which is intact. We believe that fundamentals of aluminum are robust and there should not be any major fall from current price of USD 2,500/t. However, with China increasing exports, global deficit may reduce and accordingly, it cuts average LME aluminium prices to USD 2,600/t in FY23E and USD2,400/t in FY24E, leading to 3%/6% cut in FY23E/FY24E EBITDA. With earnings cut and lower valuation multiple, we reduce our target price to Rs473 (earlier Rs573), valuing Novelis at 6.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA and Indian operations at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA. At CMP, the stock is trading at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA, which is near to a decade low.

If a stock trades above 50-DMA and 200-DMA, it usually means the immediate trend is upward. On the other hand, if the stock trades below 50-DMA and 200-DMA, it is considered a bearish trend and if trades between these averages, then it suggests the stock can go either way. \\n\\n The stock traded below the signal line of momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalling a bearish bias on the counter. The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect \\\"buy\\\" or \\\"sell\\\" opportunities. \\n\\n On the other hand, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the stock stands at 46.22.

The brokerage believe that the stock has factored in pessimism and market failed to single out the companies like HNDL whose earnings are relatively less susceptible to commodity prices and ~60% of EBITDA comes from conversion business which is intact. We believe that fundamentals of aluminum are robust and there should not be any major fall from current price of USD 2,500/t. However, with China increasing exports, global deficit may reduce and accordingly, it cuts average LME aluminium prices to USD 2,600/t in FY23E and USD2,400/t in FY24E, leading to 3%/6% cut in FY23E/FY24E EBITDA. With earnings cut and lower valuation multiple, we reduce our target price to Rs473 (earlier Rs573), valuing Novelis at 6.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA and Indian operations at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA. At CMP, the stock is trading at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA, which is near to a decade low.

It hit a high of Rs 1285.35 and low of Rs 1242.15 during the session. \\n\\n On the technical charts, the 200-DMA of the stock stood at Rs 1180.29, while the 50-DMA was at Rs 1239.5. If a stock trades above 50-DMA and 200-DMA, it usually means the immediate trend is upward. On the other hand, if the stock trades below 50-DMA and 200-DMA, it is considered a bearish trend and if trades between these averages, then it suggests the stock can go either way. \\n\\n The stock traded below the signal line of momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalling a bearish bias on the counter. The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect \\\"buy\\\" or \\\"sell\\\" opportunities. \\n\\n On the other hand, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the stock stands at 46.22. Traditionally, a stock is considered overbought when the RSI value is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30. \\n\\n The return on equity (RoE) for the stock stood at 10.51 per cent while the Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) was at 9.56.

The brokerage believe that the stock has factored in pessimism and market failed to single out the companies like HNDL whose earnings are relatively less susceptible to commodity prices and ~60% of EBITDA comes from conversion business which is intact. We believe that fundamentals of aluminum are robust and there should not be any major fall from current price of USD 2,500/t. However, with China increasing exports, global deficit may reduce and accordingly, it cuts average LME aluminium prices to USD 2,600/t in FY23E and USD2,400/t in FY24E, leading to 3%/6% cut in FY23E/FY24E EBITDA. With earnings cut and lower valuation multiple, we reduce our target price to Rs473 (earlier Rs573), valuing Novelis at 6.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA and Indian operations at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA. At CMP, the stock is trading at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA, which is near to a decade low.

But it also held a map for how to escape.\\n\\nHer body, she learned, harbored a gene mutation, a single wrong letter of DNA in her \\u201cprion\\u201d gene, that would eventually lead to a rare brain condition called fatal familial insomnia. Her mother had died of it the year before, and the test had revealed Vallabh had inherited the flaw too.\\n\\nBy now, the decision by Vallabh and her husband, Eric Minikel, to try to prevent her disease\\u2014\\u201ca prion love story,\\u201d the New Yorker called it\\u2014is well-known. After the diagnosis of the genetic time bomb, they dropped out of their careers in law and engineering and became scientists dedicated to defusing it. They expect to get PhDs next spring (see \\u201cSonia Vallabh, 35 Innovators Under 35, 2016\\u201d.)\\n\\nNow, after seven years, they think they have found a treatment that can do it. It\\u2019s called an antisense drug, a type of mirror-image molecule that, if it reaches the brain, could greatly reduce the amount of the prion protein. That could potentially forestall the mysterious chain reaction of misfolding proteins that characterize prion diseases.\\n\\nLess of the protein, Vallabh reasons, and less chance she\\u2019ll get sick.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, on their blog, Vallabh announced she and Minikel were working with a commercial partner, the California biotech company Ionis, which specializes in antisense compounds. \\u201cFor the first time, I am optimistic about a specific therapeutic strategy,\\u201d she wrote. It\\u2019s \\u201cplausible\\u201d that antisense could treat the disease \\u201cin our lifetime.\\u201d\\n\\nVallabh\\u2019s race to prevent her own prion disease raises a question for the genetic age. Given a perfect DNA blueprint of your inherited disease, what\\u2019s your chance of stopping it in your lifetime, or that of someone you love?\\n\\nThere are reasons to think these types of medical long shots have become more likely to hit the mark. That is because gene sequencing can cheaply reveal molecular flaws, but also because a set of promising technologies\\u2014antisense, gene therapy, and CRISPR gene editing\\u2014are able to replace genes or silence them, in effect fixing genetic problems at their source.\\n\\nA close-up of up brain tissue affected by prions, misfolded protein that are toxic to neurons. wikimedia commons\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s more, these treatments employ the genetic code; they are actually made of DNA or RNA. That means that they\\u2019re fundamentally modular and programmable. At least on paper, it is now possible to take any genetic flaw and quickly sketch an antidote.\\n\\nIn reality, drug development is notoriously complicated. Most drugs fail, torn down by biological surprises and unexpected toxicity to the human body. But Vallabh says in the early, confusing days of her quest, she received critical advice from Eric Lander, the biologist who leads the Broad Institute, where she and Minikel now study and work. He told her to focus on the genetic error itself\\u2014the blueprint of which was in her diagnosis.\\n\\n\\u201cYou need to see what you have in your hand and stop looking,\\u201d she recalls him saying.\\n\\nThat meant not waiting to answer important scientific unknowns, like what the prion protein does in the body, or why, when it misfolds, it kills brain cells. \\u201cThere are so many interesting questions about prion disease,\\u201d says Vallabh, who is 34. \\u201cAnd those questions will still be there when we are treating it.\\u201d\\n\\nPrion diseases are profoundly strange because they\\u2019re caused not by a virus, but by an infectious protein. They include scrapie in sheep, Kuru (spread by cannibalism), Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, and the human version of mad cow disease.\\n\\nThe key drug insight was that mice engineered to lack the prion protein gene never get sick, even when scientists inject infectious prions into their brains. \\u201cThe biological concept of a prion is a protein that changes it conformation, and that can template further copies. It\\u2019s self-templating. That allows it to spread,\\u201d says Kurt Giles, a researcher in the lab at the University of California, San Francisco, where prions were first discovered. \\u201cThat leads to the idea of reducing the [protein]. The less of it there is, then you will get less templating.\\u201d\\n\\nFor genetic therapies, though, there\\u2019s a further problem, which is how to get them into the body so that they reach, for instance, billions of brain cells.\\n\\nAntisense technology, conceived decades ago, had its big breakthrough last year when a drug developed by Ionis proved to be astoundingly effective in treating a childhood neurological disorder, spinal muscular atrophy.\\n\\nBy then, Vallabh and Minikel had been introduced to Ionis, and the company had agreed to provide them with antisense compounds targeted to the prion gene to test in mice. Holly Kordasiewicz, the head of neuroscience at Ionis, recalls the 2014 meeting. \\u201cWe left the room saying we need to do everything that we can to help these people,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nThe company gave Vallabh and Minikel a to-do list, which they quickly worked through. Patient registry? Check. Animal studies? Check. Biomarker to show if a drug is working? That research, too, is under way at a Boston hospital studying prion protein levels in spinal fluid.\\n\\n\\u201cSonia and Eric are doing this with no real funding, just trying to make it happen,\\u201d says Jeff Carroll, another patient scientist (he\\u2019s got the mutation for Huntington\\u2019s disease), who introduced them to Ionis.\\n\\nOne problem not as easily addressed is that prion disease is astoundingly rare, quickly fatal, and rarely diagnosed in advance. That means there has been no great clamor for treatments. Maybe only 200 people in the U.S. know they have a time bomb like Vallabh, she says, and there\\u2019s not a single drug currently in human testing. Early on, Ionis let the pair know the collaboration was strictly academic and not a commercial prospect.\\n\\nBut by blotting out the prion protein at its source, an antisense treatment might help with a range of rare conditions linked to it. Fatal insomnia is vanishingly uncommon, as are cases of mad cow disease, but adding these \\u201cultra-rare\\u201d diseases together makes them, as a group, slightly less rare.\\n\\nVallabh and Minikel say they now have proof that Ionis\\u2019s antisense molecules partly protect mice from prion disease. Those animals given the drug live about 70 percent longer.\\n\\nKordasiewicz now terms the program a \\u201ccommercial\\u201d project at Ionis, though it remains too small and early-stage to appear on the company\\u2019s pipeline chart of drugs under development. \\u201cWhat changed is the data is looking good enough that we think we can have a drug in five years,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nVallabh hopes it can all go even faster. The fatal insomnia could begin to afflict her tomorrow, or in 30 years. There\\u2019s no way to predict it. She and Minikel just had their first child. The girl was conceived through IVF, and Vallabh says the lab employed a genetic test to assure them she wouldn\\u2019t carry the mutation.\\n\\nTo save herself, it\\u2019s not going to be enough to have a drug. She needs to get it before she ever falls ill. Yet doctors have little experience giving such a genetic drug over many years as a form of prevention.\\n\\nFiguring out how to carry off such a study is the next challenge for Vallabh and her husband. It appears they hope the US Food and Drug Administration will permit a prevention trial in patients who carry the prion mutations. Since it can take decades for people to get sick (or not), such a study would instead rely on a biomarker, such as whether antisense injections can reduce prion protein levels in the spinal fluid.\\n\\nVallabh told me she would volunteer to take the drug. \\u201cThe big picture,\\u201d she says, \\u201cis we are moving much more quickly than anyone could expect due to this beautifully clear genetic blueprint we were handed.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 848,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/02/24/crossroads-church-nonprofit-wipe-out-46-5-million-medical-debt/4854753002/?fbclid=IwAR1MMDWZKi9U_rQ8bwSZB_irls6Ejjqgu4oMrZuozZ23yI8qG5tIEKw59-s\",\n          \"https://theweek.com/speedreads/879727/austria-turning-site-hitlers-birth-into-police-station-repel-neonazis\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

But it also held a map for how to escape.\\n\\nHer body, she learned, harbored a gene mutation, a single wrong letter of DNA in her \\u201cprion\\u201d gene, that would eventually lead to a rare brain condition called fatal familial insomnia. Her mother had died of it the year before, and the test had revealed Vallabh had inherited the flaw too.\\n\\nBy now, the decision by Vallabh and her husband, Eric Minikel, to try to prevent her disease\\u2014\\u201ca prion love story,\\u201d the New Yorker called it\\u2014is well-known. After the diagnosis of the genetic time bomb, they dropped out of their careers in law and engineering and became scientists dedicated to defusing it. They expect to get PhDs next spring (see \\u201cSonia Vallabh, 35 Innovators Under 35, 2016\\u201d.)\\n\\nNow, after seven years, they think they have found a treatment that can do it. It\\u2019s called an antisense drug, a type of mirror-image molecule that, if it reaches the brain, could greatly reduce the amount of the prion protein. That could potentially forestall the mysterious chain reaction of misfolding proteins that characterize prion diseases.\\n\\nLess of the protein, Vallabh reasons, and less chance she\\u2019ll get sick.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, on their blog, Vallabh announced she and Minikel were working with a commercial partner, the California biotech company Ionis, which specializes in antisense compounds. \\u201cFor the first time, I am optimistic about a specific therapeutic strategy,\\u201d she wrote. It\\u2019s \\u201cplausible\\u201d that antisense could treat the disease \\u201cin our lifetime.\\u201d\\n\\nVallabh\\u2019s race to prevent her own prion disease raises a question for the genetic age. Given a perfect DNA blueprint of your inherited disease, what\\u2019s your chance of stopping it in your lifetime, or that of someone you love?\\n\\nThere are reasons to think these types of medical long shots have become more likely to hit the mark. That is because gene sequencing can cheaply reveal molecular flaws, but also because a set of promising technologies\\u2014antisense, gene therapy, and CRISPR gene editing\\u2014are able to replace genes or silence them, in effect fixing genetic problems at their source.\\n\\nA close-up of up brain tissue affected by prions, misfolded protein that are toxic to neurons. wikimedia commons\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s more, these treatments employ the genetic code; they are actually made of DNA or RNA. That means that they\\u2019re fundamentally modular and programmable. At least on paper, it is now possible to take any genetic flaw and quickly sketch an antidote.\\n\\nIn reality, drug development is notoriously complicated. Most drugs fail, torn down by biological surprises and unexpected toxicity to the human body. But Vallabh says in the early, confusing days of her quest, she received critical advice from Eric Lander, the biologist who leads the Broad Institute, where she and Minikel now study and work. He told her to focus on the genetic error itself\\u2014the blueprint of which was in her diagnosis.\\n\\n\\u201cYou need to see what you have in your hand and stop looking,\\u201d she recalls him saying.\\n\\nThat meant not waiting to answer important scientific unknowns, like what the prion protein does in the body, or why, when it misfolds, it kills brain cells. \\u201cThere are so many interesting questions about prion disease,\\u201d says Vallabh, who is 34. \\u201cAnd those questions will still be there when we are treating it.\\u201d\\n\\nPrion diseases are profoundly strange because they\\u2019re caused not by a virus, but by an infectious protein. They include scrapie in sheep, Kuru (spread by cannibalism), Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, and the human version of mad cow disease.\\n\\nThe key drug insight was that mice engineered to lack the prion protein gene never get sick, even when scientists inject infectious prions into their brains. \\u201cThe biological concept of a prion is a protein that changes it conformation, and that can template further copies. It\\u2019s self-templating. That allows it to spread,\\u201d says Kurt Giles, a researcher in the lab at the University of California, San Francisco, where prions were first discovered. \\u201cThat leads to the idea of reducing the [protein]. The less of it there is, then you will get less templating.\\u201d\\n\\nFor genetic therapies, though, there\\u2019s a further problem, which is how to get them into the body so that they reach, for instance, billions of brain cells.\\n\\nAntisense technology, conceived decades ago, had its big breakthrough last year when a drug developed by Ionis proved to be astoundingly effective in treating a childhood neurological disorder, spinal muscular atrophy.\\n\\nBy then, Vallabh and Minikel had been introduced to Ionis, and the company had agreed to provide them with antisense compounds targeted to the prion gene to test in mice. Holly Kordasiewicz, the head of neuroscience at Ionis, recalls the 2014 meeting. \\u201cWe left the room saying we need to do everything that we can to help these people,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nThe company gave Vallabh and Minikel a to-do list, which they quickly worked through. Patient registry? Check. Animal studies? Check. Biomarker to show if a drug is working? That research, too, is under way at a Boston hospital studying prion protein levels in spinal fluid.\\n\\n\\u201cSonia and Eric are doing this with no real funding, just trying to make it happen,\\u201d says Jeff Carroll, another patient scientist (he\\u2019s got the mutation for Huntington\\u2019s disease), who introduced them to Ionis.\\n\\nOne problem not as easily addressed is that prion disease is astoundingly rare, quickly fatal, and rarely diagnosed in advance. That means there has been no great clamor for treatments. Maybe only 200 people in the U.S. know they have a time bomb like Vallabh, she says, and there\\u2019s not a single drug currently in human testing. Early on, Ionis let the pair know the collaboration was strictly academic and not a commercial prospect.\\n\\nBut by blotting out the prion protein at its source, an antisense treatment might help with a range of rare conditions linked to it. Fatal insomnia is vanishingly uncommon, as are cases of mad cow disease, but adding these \\u201cultra-rare\\u201d diseases together makes them, as a group, slightly less rare.\\n\\nVallabh and Minikel say they now have proof that Ionis\\u2019s antisense molecules partly protect mice from prion disease. Those animals given the drug live about 70 percent longer.\\n\\nKordasiewicz now terms the program a \\u201ccommercial\\u201d project at Ionis, though it remains too small and early-stage to appear on the company\\u2019s pipeline chart of drugs under development. \\u201cWhat changed is the data is looking good enough that we think we can have a drug in five years,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nVallabh hopes it can all go even faster. The fatal insomnia could begin to afflict her tomorrow, or in 30 years. There\\u2019s no way to predict it. She and Minikel just had their first child. The girl was conceived through IVF, and Vallabh says the lab employed a genetic test to assure them she wouldn\\u2019t carry the mutation.\\n\\nTo save herself, it\\u2019s not going to be enough to have a drug. She needs to get it before she ever falls ill. Yet doctors have little experience giving such a genetic drug over many years as a form of prevention.\\n\\nFiguring out how to carry off such a study is the next challenge for Vallabh and her husband. It appears they hope the US Food and Drug Administration will permit a prevention trial in patients who carry the prion mutations. Since it can take decades for people to get sick (or not), such a study would instead rely on a biomarker, such as whether antisense injections can reduce prion protein levels in the spinal fluid.\\n\\nVallabh told me she would volunteer to take the drug. \\u201cThe big picture,\\u201d she says, \\u201cis we are moving much more quickly than anyone could expect due to this beautifully clear genetic blueprint we were handed.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 848,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/02/24/crossroads-church-nonprofit-wipe-out-46-5-million-medical-debt/4854753002/?fbclid=IwAR1MMDWZKi9U_rQ8bwSZB_irls6Ejjqgu4oMrZuozZ23yI8qG5tIEKw59-s\",\n          \"https://theweek.com/speedreads/879727/austria-turning-site-hitlers-birth-into-police-station-repel-neonazis\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Scientists working on experimental atomic clocks at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have reported three new performance records for their clocks. The team says that the clocks have improved accuracy enough that not only are they going to improve timekeeping and navigation, but they may be sensitive enough to detect faint signals from gravity, the early universe, and dark matter.\\n\\nEach of the new atomic clocks traps a thousand ytterbium atoms in grids that are made of laser beams. The atoms tick by switching between two energy levels. The researchers can compare the two independent clocks allowing them to improve systematic uncertainty, stability, and reproducibility.\\n\\nSystematic uncertainty is how well the clock can represent the natural vibrations of the atoms captured in the laser lattice. The team found the clock had a possible error of one billionth of a billionth from the natural ticking frequency of the atoms. Stability is how much the clock frequency changes over time, in this case, it changes 0.00000000000000000032 during a day. Reproducibility is how close the two clocks tick at the same frequency, the frequency difference was less than one billionth of a billionth in this test.\\n\\nThe ytterbium atomic clocks exceed the conventional capability to measure the shape of the Earth (geodetic measurement) based on tidal gauge surveys of sea level. Researchers say that a comparison of these clocks located far apart, on different continents, could provide geodetic measurements within 1 centimeter, better than the current several centimeters.\\n\\nSome of the improvements to the new clock include thermal and electric shielding that surrounds atoms to protect them from stray electric fields. Ytterbium atoms are one of the potential candidates to be used in the future redefinition of the second. Scientists are currently redefining all sorts of measurements, including a recent redefinition of how to describe a kilogram.\",\n          \"The Mayor of Flavortown is giving back to restaurant workers around the country.\\n\\nGuy Fieri has helped raise more than $20 million by partnering with the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, he announced in an interview with TMZ. He and the organization have been sending restaurant workers $500 grants through the newly created Restaurant Employee Relief Fund.\\n\\nAfter less than two months, Fieri has awarded more than 40,000 grants. During the interview on Thursday, he said the total amount they have raised is $21.5 million.\\n\\n\\u201cI started thinking about my brothers and sisters in the restaurant business, and a bunch of restaurants that I was closing \\u2014 we gotta do something,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe \\u201cDiners, Drive-Ins and Dives\\u201d star said he personally reached out to several food service companies, like Pepsi, Coke and Uber Eats, to donate money to the charitable cause.\\n\\n\\u201cI started sending personal video invitations to all the heavy-hitter CEOs that are involved in the restaurant business,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAs long as the money comes in, we\\u2019re going to continue to give these grants.\\u201d\\n\\nMost restaurants and bars around the country have been closed in the wake of the shelter-in-place rules during the coronavirus pandemic.

Scientists working on experimental atomic clocks at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have reported three new performance records for their clocks. The team says that the clocks have improved accuracy enough that not only are they going to improve timekeeping and navigation, but they may be sensitive enough to detect faint signals from gravity, the early universe, and dark matter.\\n\\nEach of the new atomic clocks traps a thousand ytterbium atoms in grids that are made of laser beams. The atoms tick by switching between two energy levels. The researchers can compare the two independent clocks allowing them to improve systematic uncertainty, stability, and reproducibility.\\n\\nSystematic uncertainty is how well the clock can represent the natural vibrations of the atoms captured in the laser lattice. The team found the clock had a possible error of one billionth of a billionth from the natural ticking frequency of the atoms. Stability is how much the clock frequency changes over time, in this case, it changes 0.00000000000000000032 during a day. Reproducibility is how close the two clocks tick at the same frequency, the frequency difference was less than one billionth of a billionth in this test.\\n\\nThe ytterbium atomic clocks exceed the conventional capability to measure the shape of the Earth (geodetic measurement) based on tidal gauge surveys of sea level. Researchers say that a comparison of these clocks located far apart, on different continents, could provide geodetic measurements within 1 centimeter, better than the current several centimeters.\\n\\nSome of the improvements to the new clock include thermal and electric shielding that surrounds atoms to protect them from stray electric fields. Ytterbium atoms are one of the potential candidates to be used in the future redefinition of the second. Scientists are currently redefining all sorts of measurements, including a recent redefinition of how to describe a kilogram.\",\n          \"The Mayor of Flavortown is giving back to restaurant workers around the country.\\n\\nGuy Fieri has helped raise more than $20 million by partnering with the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, he announced in an interview with TMZ. He and the organization have been sending restaurant workers $500 grants through the newly created Restaurant Employee Relief Fund.\\n\\nAfter less than two months, Fieri has awarded more than 40,000 grants. During the interview on Thursday, he said the total amount they have raised is $21.5 million.\\n\\n\\u201cI started thinking about my brothers and sisters in the restaurant business, and a bunch of restaurants that I was closing \\u2014 we gotta do something,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe \\u201cDiners, Drive-Ins and Dives\\u201d star said he personally reached out to several food service companies, like Pepsi, Coke and Uber Eats, to donate money to the charitable cause.\\n\\n\\u201cI started sending personal video invitations to all the heavy-hitter CEOs that are involved in the restaurant business,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAs long as the money comes in, we\\u2019re going to continue to give these grants.\\u201d\\n\\nMost restaurants and bars around the country have been closed in the wake of the shelter-in-place rules during the coronavirus pandemic.

A new report now sheds more light on how this feature might work, and what it could offer. Google Messages with satellite connectivity will reportedly offer a two-way communication allowing people to converse with each other without requiring mobile network or internet connectivity. Last week, areporthighlighted that the tech giant has started rolling out a new beta version of the Google Messages app with the integration of itsartificial intelligence(AI) chatbot Gemini.\\nSpottedby 9to5Google, details about the satellite messaging feature within Google Messages was found within the app's latest beta version 20240329_01_RC00. Strings of codes with three different explanations of the feature was seen by the publication. The first stated, \\u201cTo send and receive, stay outside with a clear view of the sky,\\u201d and the second explained, \\u201cSatellite messaging may take longer and can't include photos & videos.\\u201d\\nBut the most interesting was the third explanatory string which said, \\u201cYou can message with anyone, including emergency services.\\u201d The phrasing is notable, as it suggests that users can text anyone in their contact list as long as they too have the service enabled. This is quite different from whatAppleoffers on theiPhone, where users can only contact emergency services, roadside assistance, and share location via Find My. While users can share the conversation with emergency responders with their emergency contacts, it does not allow users to directly communicate with other users.\\nThe report highlights that Google is able to offer two-way communication due to its partnership with GPS navigation giantGarmin, which already offers this functionality. It is unclear whether users will see this feature beforeAndroid15 officially rolls out to public. The next Android OS reportedly comes with an \\u201cAuto-connected to satellite\\u201d notification as well as a satellite icon in the status bar.\\nGoogle Messagesis also working on improving its core functionalities. Recently, areportsaid that the messaging app is working on improvements to its image-sharing interface, specifically upgrading the functionality of sending multiple images that are taken by the in-app camera.\\nFor the latesttech newsandreviews, follow Gadgets 360 onX,Facebook,WhatsApp,ThreadsandGoogle News.
